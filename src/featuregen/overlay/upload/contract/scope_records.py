"""Phase-1B Task 2 — scope-record persistence (the recognition -> run -> scope lineage).

Three append-only writers/readers over the ``0974_intent_scope_records`` tables:

* :func:`record_recognition_attempt` — persists the recognizer's PROPOSAL for an intent, BEFORE any
  generation run exists. Idempotent on ``(intent_id, input_hash)``: the same intent + redacted input
  resolves to the SAME ``recognition_id`` (never a second row), so re-recognising is free.
* :func:`record_confirmed_scope` — writes the human-confirmed governing scope for exactly one
  generation run (parent) plus one normalized child per accepted use-case, each stamped with its
  ``origin`` (``llm_proposed``/``user_added``/``user_overridden``). The proposals (on the attempt) and
  the choices (child rows) are both retained, joined by ``recognition_id`` — so the proposed-vs-accepted
  delta stays queryable.
* :func:`scope_for_run` — the CANONICAL lookup: the governing scope for a run, by run id only (the
  ``UNIQUE(generation_run_id)`` linkage). Never latest-by-time; ``supersedes_scope_id`` is lineage only.
* :func:`confirmation_delta` — the proposed-vs-confirmed DIMENSION delta for a run: the attempt's
  proposed ``modelling_contexts``/``target_entity`` reconciled against the confirmed dimension child
  rows (accepted / rejected / added / replaced), joined by ``recognition_id``.

Computation-free and behaviour-neutral: scope persistence lives here / in the API layer, never in
``build_considered_set``. See ``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-phase1b-scoped-grounding.md`` Task 2.
