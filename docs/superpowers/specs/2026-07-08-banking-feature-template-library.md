# Banking Feature Template Library (SME-authored)

**Status:** draft for review · **Date:** 2026-07-08 · **Author stance:** banking SME.
**What this is:** the B2 *content* — a comprehensive, **parametric, safe-by-construction** template
library (the "cookbook"). Templates **seed** generation; the LLM extends beyond them and un-templated
requests still work (scaffold-not-cage). These are **expert-curated / conventional** patterns — **not**
data-proven (no data plane); the golden set is the quality bar.

## Template schema (every entry uses this)

```
id            snake_case unique
family        which pattern group
intent        one-line business meaning
computes      the logic, with {parameters} and {column roles}
needs         required concept(s)/entity — the grounding contract (what columns it binds to)
params        {p} ∈ {allowed} (default)
grain         one value per {entity} per as_of
pit           point-in-time rule (leakage-safety BAKED IN — only pre-as_of data)
add           additivity of the OUTPUT: additive | semi | non | n/a
eligibility   sensitivity/regulatory note (e.g. never bind a protected_attribute)
explain       H / M / L (interpretability — H required for credit/pricing symbolic mode)
use           primary use-cases
```
> **Global PIT rule (applies to ALL):** a template binds only to columns whose values are knowable
> **before `as_of`**, over a **trailing** window `(as_of − {window}, as_of]`; it may NEVER read the
> target's `label_column` or its `source_columns` (leakage). Windows are trailing, never forward.

# PART A — Cross-cutting families (the workhorses, reused everywhere)

## A1. Recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) & inter-event

- **`recency_days`** — time since the last event. computes: `as_of − max({event_ts} < as_of)`.
  needs: an `event_timestamp` on {entity}. grain: per {entity} per as_of. pit: last event strictly
  before as_of. add: n/a. explain: H. use: churn, engagement, collections, fraud(dormancy).

  params: window ∈ {7,30,90,180,365}d. needs: event on {entity}. pit: trailing. add: additive.
  explain: H. use: churn, cross-sell, AML(activity), fraud.
- **`monetary_sum`** — total value in window. computes: `sum({monetary_flow} in window)`. needs: a
  `monetary_flow` (+ `currency_code` — convert to base first). add: additive. explain: H. use: CLV,
  cross-sell, AML, credit-affordability.
- **`monetary_avg`** / **`monetary_max`** — mean / peak flow in window. add: n/a. use: pricing, credit.

  `event_frequency`, `monetary_sum`. explain: H. use: churn, cross-sell, segmentation, CLV.
- **`inter_event_gap_mean`** / **`inter_event_gap_std`** — regularity of behaviour. computes: mean/std of
  gaps between consecutive events in window. needs: event_timestamp. explain: M. use: churn (salary
  irregularity), fraud (bursty), AML (structuring cadence).
- **`event_recency_trend`** — is activity accelerating or decaying. computes: ratio of count in recent
  half-window vs prior half-window. explain: M. use: churn (decay), fraud (ramp-up).

## A2. Rolling aggregates & trends (time-series over an entity)

- **`rolling_sum`** / **`rolling_avg`** / **`rolling_min`** / **`rolling_max`** — window aggregate of a
  numeric column. params: window, agg. needs: a numeric column + timestamp. add: sum→additive,
  others n/a. explain: H. use: universal.

  use: fraud(off-pattern), cash-flow forecasting.
- **`streak_length`** — consecutive periods meeting a condition. computes: longest run where {col}
  {op} {threshold} in window. use: credit(consecutive months in credit), churn(consecutive dormant).

## A3. Balance / stock behaviour (semi-additive)

- **`balance_end_of_period`** — latest balance as-of. add: semi. use: universal.
- **`balance_avg`** / **`balance_min`** / **`balance_max`** — window stats of a `monetary_stock`.
  use: credit(min balance), churn(draining).
- **`balance_trend`** — slope of a `monetary_stock` over window (the salary/churn workhorse). eligibility:
  bind a `monetary_stock`, not a flow. explain: H. use: churn, deposit attrition, early-warning.
- **`days_below_threshold`** — days the balance sat under a floor. computes: count(days {stock} <
  {threshold} in window). params: threshold. use: overdraft propensity, churn, hardship.
- **`balance_volatility`** — std of daily balance / mean. use: cash-flow risk, SME credit.
- **`drawdown_depth`** — peak-to-trough drop in window. use: markets, liquidity stress.

## A4. Ratios & cross-features (non-additive — compute per row, never sum)

- **`utilization_ratio`** — used vs limit. computes: `{drawn}/{limit}`. add: non. explain: H. use:
  credit(card utilisation), early-warning, pricing.
- **`debt_to_income`** — obligations vs income. computes: `sum({obligations})/{income}`. eligibility:
  income is sensitive; permitted for credit. use: credit_origination, affordability.

  early-warning.
- **`payment_to_due_ratio`** — paid vs scheduled. computes: `sum(payments)/sum(due)` in window. use:
  collections, behavioral credit, delinquency.

## A5. Categorical, mix & diversity

- **`category_count_distinct`** — variety used. computes: `count(distinct {category_code} in window)`.
  use: merchant-category diversity (fraud/AML), product breadth.
- **`category_share`** — concentration in a category. computes: share of events/amount in {category}.
  use: channel preference, spend mix, AML(cash share).
- **`preferred_category`** — modal category in window (target-encode, don't one-hot high-cardinality).
  explain: H. use: next-best-action, channel routing.
- **`herfindahl_concentration`** — HHI over a categorical distribution. use: revenue concentration,
  counterparty concentration risk.

## A6. Entity aggregation — children → parent, and group hierarchy (§1.9)

- **`child_count`** — number of child entities. computes: `count({child} of {parent})`. e.g. accounts
  per customer, transactions per account. add: additive up the tree. use: engagement, exposure.
- **`child_amount_sum`** / **`child_amount_avg`** — aggregate a child metric to the parent. pit: child
  rows pre-as_of. use: customer-level spend, group-level revenue.
- **`group_exposure_sum`** — **combined exposure across a corporate group** (sum lending + trade + SCF +
  derivatives up the `part_of_group` hierarchy). needs: exposure + group edges. use: early-warning,
  limit-setting, concentration. *(Corporate-critical — a subsidiary's risk needs the group total.)*
- **`product_breadth`** — distinct product families held. use: share-of-wallet, cross-sell, churn.
- **`share_of_wallet_proxy`** — held products vs the catalog of eligible products. use: cross-sell, CLV.

## A7. Tenure, lifecycle & vintage

- **`tenure_days`** — age of the relationship/account. computes: `as_of − {origination_date}`. explain:
  H. use: churn, credit(seasoning), pricing.
- **`months_on_book`** — for credit behavioural scoring. use: PD-behavioral, IFRS9.
- **`time_to_maturity`** — for lending/markets. computes: `{maturity_date} − as_of`. use: prepayment,
  ALM, markets.
- **`lifecycle_state_at`** — the product's state as-of (origination/active/delinquent/…). needs:
  `lifecycle_state` + valid history. use: gating any downstream feature; collections.

## A8. Distributional, peer-relative & anomaly

- **`percentile_in_peer_group`** — rank within a segment. computes: percentile of {metric} within
  {segment} as-of. eligibility: segment must not be a protected class. explain: M. use: pricing,
  credit, anomaly.
- **`zscore_vs_segment`** — deviation from segment mean. use: fraud, early-warning.
- **`zscore_vs_own_history`** — deviation from the entity's own baseline (anomaly). computes: `({col}@as_of
  − rolling_avg)/rolling_std`. explain: M. use: fraud (spend spike), AML (out-of-pattern).
- **`novelty_flag`** — first-seen {attribute} for this entity (new merchant/country/device). use: fraud,
  AML. eligibility: geolocation is a proxy — flag, don't use as a credit input.

## A9. Primacy / relationship-outflow (money moving to a competitor) — needs a DERIVED intermediate

Signals that a customer is quietly relocating their primary relationship — a top-tier pre-attrition
indicator. **Distinctive because the key flag is not in the data — it must be derived** (see Part D.8).

- **`external_own_transfer_trend`** — rising transfers of the customer's OWN money to their accounts at
  OTHER banks. **derive:** `is_own_external_transfer := name_match(customer.name, beneficiary_name) ≥
  {threshold} AND beneficiary_bank ≠ home_bank` *(computed **downstream** — no data plane here)*.
  **computes:** growth of {amount|count} of `is_own_external_transfer`, recent window vs baseline.
  needs: `transactions.beneficiary_name` + `beneficiary_bank` + amount + timestamp; `customer.name`;
  {customer}. params: window · baseline · measure · `match_method ∈ {exact,token,fuzzy}` ·
  `match_threshold`. pit: trailing. add: n/a. **eligibility:** uses `customer_name` + `beneficiary_name`
  → PII entity-resolution — consent/purpose/residency REQUIRED. **match-risk:** probabilistic — false-pos
  (same name), false-neg (initials/order/joint accounts) → DECLARE method+threshold; `explain: M`.
  use: retail_churn, deposit_attrition, primacy_loss, wealth_outflow.
- **`external_outflow_growth`** *(fallback when no name to match)* — growth of ALL external outflows.
  Weaker + **FLAGGED** (includes third-party payments — noisier). use: same, as a proxy.
- **`salary_diversion_flag`** — inbound salary credit stops/shrinks while an external own-transfer rises.
  use: primacy_loss (the strongest variant — losing the salary is losing the relationship).

# PART B — Domain-specific templates

> **Library complete — all 15 families now have full parametric recipes** (`templates.py`, grounded by the
> engine): the appendices **§PART F–L** implement every B-family (F churn · G credit · H fraud+AML · I
> collections+deposits+payments · J markets+custody+asset-mgmt · K insurance+islamic+esg · **L cross-sell/CLV
> + corporate-trade/SCF**). `ALL_TEMPLATES` is the 15-family union; grounding is the router (the locked
> churn=churn-lens invariant holds — each family surfaces only where its distinctive concepts exist).

## B1. Churn / attrition — the attrition FUNNEL

Attrition is a process, not an event. Signals sit at stages: **earlier = more lead-time but noisier;
later = near-certain but too late (and near-label → leakage risk).** A good model blends stages.

```
DISSATISFACTION → DISENGAGEMENT → FINANCIAL MIGRATION → UNBUNDLING → DEPARTURE ⚠near-label
```

**Stage 1 — Dissatisfaction (leading, weak, most lead-time)**
- `complaint_recent_flag` — a complaint filed in window. needs: complaint/interaction records.
- `fee_reversal_then_balance_drop` — fee dispute followed by balance decline. needs: fee events+balance.
- `dispute_unresolved_count` — open disputes. `failed_contact_rate` — unresolved service contacts.

**Stage 2 — Disengagement (behavioural, early)**
- `digital_login_decline` — `trend_slope` of logins (falling). needs: session events.
- `channel_abandonment` — stopped using a previously-used channel. needs: channel-tagged activity.
- `comms_disengagement` — stopped opening statements / unsubscribed. needs: comms open events.
- `engagement_decay` — `event_recency_trend` on logins/txns. `product_usage_decline` — fewer features used.

**Stage 3 — Financial migration (mid, STRONG — the money is moving)**
- `salary_cessation_flag` / `salary_decline_trend` — inbound salary stops/shrinks. needs: credit txns +
  salary tag. eligibility: income sensitive. `salary_irregularity` — `inter_event_gap_std` on salary.
- `external_own_transfer_trend` — own money → competitor (§A9). PII entity-resolution.
- `card_spend_decline_trend` — `trend_slope` of card volume. needs: card txns.
- `share_of_spend_decline` — this bank's spend ÷ total known spend. needs: external spend view.
- `net_inflow_decline` — total credits falling. `deposit_runoff` — term deposits maturing, not renewed.
- `balance_decline_slope` — `balance_trend` over 90d (the core drain signal).

**Stage 4 — Unbundling (late, STRONG — dismantling the relationship)**
- `direct_debit_cancellation_rate` — DDs (utilities/mortgage) cancelled. needs: DD/mandate data. *(strong
  — sticky "furniture" leaving.)*
- `standing_order_redirection` — SOs redirected external. needs: SO data + beneficiary. PII.
- `product_closure_count` — products closed. `tier_downgrade_flag` — premium→basic.
- `product_attrition` — drop in `product_breadth`. `mortgage_redemption_signal` — early redemption
  (remortgage elsewhere?).

**Stage 5 — Departure ⚠ (NEAR-LABEL — high leakage risk, usually FLAG/REJECT)**
- `account_switch_service_flag` (CASS) — a formal switch request. **⚠ almost the outcome itself → the
  3-part leakage control must flag/reject** (else the model predicts churn using churn).
- `full_balance_withdrawal_flag` — account emptied. **⚠ near-label — flag.**

**Composite**
- `relationship_erosion_score` — weighted blend, **weighted by lead-time × strength**; keep inspectable
  (`explain: H`) so a human sees which stage fired. `dormancy_days` = `recency_days` (the baseline signal).

> **Two funnel rules:** (1) **lead-time vs strength is a trade-off** — blend stages, don't rely on one;
> (2) **the bottom of the funnel is a leakage trap** — Stage-5 signals are *almost the label*; flag/reject
> (the sharper cousin of the `days_since_last_txn` case).

## B2. Credit risk — the DETERIORATION → DEFAULT funnel
```
HEALTHY → EARLY STRESS → EMERGING DISTRESS → DELINQUENCY → DEFAULT ⚠ → RECOVERY/LOSS
```
Maps to **IFRS9 staging** (Stage 1 performing → 2 SICR → 3 credit-impaired). Fair-lending: **no protected
attributes**; income/geo flagged.
- **Stage 0 — Origination baseline (static, at application):** `dti_at_origination`, `ltv_at_origination`,
  bureau score, `bureau_recent_inquiries`, tenure-at-application. use: application PD, pricing.
- **Stage 1 — Early stress (behavioural, leading):** `utilisation_trend` (rising), revolving-balance
  growth, `cash_advance_usage` (classic distress), `income_volatility`, deposit-balance decline,
  overdraft-usage rising.
- **Stage 2 — Emerging distress (stronger):** first late payment, `payment_ratio_avg` falling,
  `times_over_limit`, **cross-lender bureau deterioration** (new inquiries/delinquencies elsewhere),
  `nsf_returned_payments` (failed DDs).
- **Stage 3 — Delinquency (strong):** `max_dpd_in_window`, `delinquency_count`, consecutive misses,
  `roll_rate_signal` (→ worse bucket), `worst_status_in_window`.
- **Stage 4 — Default ⚠ (NEAR-LABEL):** 90+ DPD (**often IS the Basel default label** → leakage trap,
  flag/reject), charge-off, `forbearance_restructure_flag` (also near-label).
- **Stage 5 — Recovery/Loss:** `cure_probability` inputs, recovery rate, LGD/`downturn_lgd`.
> Trap: Stage-4 (90+ DPD, forbearance) ≈ the default label — the 3-part leakage control must flag/reject.
> **Full parametric set:** the 16 grounded recipes implementing this funnel are in **§PART G** (the
> `credit_risk` appendix) ↔ `templates.py::CREDIT_RISK_TEMPLATES`.

## B3. Fraud — the KILL-CHAIN (real-time; windows are minutes/hours, not weeks)
```
RECON → ACCESS/TAKEOVER → SETUP/STAGING → CASH-OUT ⚠
```
Types: card (CNP), account-takeover (ATO), application (synthetic-ID), first-party (bust-out).
- **Stage 1 — Recon/targeting:** `failed_login_spike` (credential-stuffing), unusual profile lookups,
  `application_velocity` (shared email/phone/device across apps → synthetic-ID).
- **Stage 2 — Access/takeover:** `device_change_flag` (novel device), `geo_velocity_impossible`,
  `time_since_credential_change` (password/contact just changed), MFA change, dormant-account reactivation.
- **Stage 3 — Setup/staging:** `new_beneficiary_flag`, limit-increase request, payee added then a quiet
  "aging" gap (the mule trick), contact-detail change before a payment.
- **Stage 4 — Cash-out ⚠ (NEAR-LABEL):** `txn_velocity` spike, `amount_zscore` spike, rapid drain,
  high-value transfer to a new beneficiary, mule-pattern outflow. **⚠ the fraudulent txn IS often the
  label → flag.**
> Note: fraud is **real-time** — `pit` windows are short; features must compute on the live pre-txn state.
> **Full parametric set:** the 11 grounded recipes implementing this kill-chain are in **§PART H** (the
> fraud + AML appendix) ↔ `templates.py::FRAUD_TEMPLATES`.

## B4. AML — the LAUNDERING cycle (typology-driven)
```
PLACEMENT → LAYERING → INTEGRATION
```
Labels are **SARs (suspicion, not proof)** — weak/noisy; a filed SAR is **near-label** (don't use as a
feature). Geo/nationality are proxies → AML-permitted but bias-watched.
- **Placement (dirty money enters):** `cash_intensity`, `structuring_score` (just under threshold),
  rapid third-party deposits.
- **Layering (obscure the trail):** `rapid_movement_ratio` (in-then-out), `round_amount_share`,
  round-tripping, `network_degree` (mule rings), pass-through accounts, `high_risk_geo_share`.
- **Integration (clean money returns):** asset purchase, business-income mixing, **TBML** (over/under-
  invoicing), `shortest_path_to_flagged` (proximity to known-bad).
> Cross-cutting: `zscore_vs_own_history` (out-of-pattern), velocity, network position.
> **Full parametric set:** the 11 grounded recipes implementing this cycle are in **§PART H** (the
> fraud + AML appendix) ↔ `templates.py::AML_TEMPLATES`.

## B5. Cross-sell / CLV — the GROWTH journey (the INVERSE of attrition)
```
ONBOARDING → ACTIVATION → DEEPENING → MATURITY → ADVOCACY
```
The **positive mirror of B1** — the *same* signals read in reverse (rising salary/breadth = growth;
falling = attrition). Eligibility: **no protected-attribute inference** (can't infer pregnancy/health for
targeting).
- **Onboarding:** account funded, first salary credit (**primacy won**), early logins.
- **Activation:** `direct_debit_setup` (sticky), card activated, digital enrolled, regular usage.
- **Deepening (cross-sell windows):** `product_breadth` growing, `product_gap_flag`, `life_event_proxy`
  (salary jump → mortgage; large inflow → wealth), `channel_engagement`.
- **Maturity:** high `share_of_wallet_proxy`, multi-product, high `revenue_trend`/CLV, stable.
- **Advocacy:** referrals, sustained high engagement.
> **Full parametric set:** the 10 grounded recipes covering the growth journey (channel adoption, product-gap
> whitespace, next-best-product propensity, relationship-deepening breadth GROWTH, campaign response, CLV /
> revenue trajectory, share-of-wallet growth, peer-relative penetration, household/RM aggregation, tenure
> upsell readiness) — all built from PRE-purchase BEHAVIOUR, NEVER the conversion label — are in **§PART L** ↔
> `templates.py::CROSS_SELL_TEMPLATES`. ⚠ CLV is the INVERSE of churn and shares its generic concepts, so
> every recipe additionally anchors on a NON-STRUCTURAL distinctive concept (`product_type`/`segment`/
> `peer_group`/`channel`) to hold the churn=churn-lens invariant; CLV is a declared projection.

## B6. Collections & recoveries — the DELINQUENCY → RECOVERY journey
```
PRE-DELINQUENCY → EARLY (1–29 DPD) → MID (30–89) → LATE (90+) → RECOVERY / CHARGE-OFF
```
Optimise by **balance-at-risk × cure-probability × contactability**; segment self-curers from
needs-intervention. Conduct: **vulnerability** flag (sensitive) → different handling.
- **Pre-delinquency:** the B2 early-warning signals (predict who'll miss).
- **Early (1–29):** first miss, `self_cure_likelihood`, `promise_to_pay` behaviour.
- **Mid (30–89):** `roll_rate_signal`, `promise_kept_ratio`, `right_party_contact_rate`, partial payments.
- **Late (90+):** severity, `balance_at_risk`, hardship indicators.
- **Recovery/charge-off:** `cure_probability`, recovery rate, settlement propensity, legal/write-off.
> Trap: the recovery/charge-off tail is the leakage trap — `recovery_amount`/`write_off_amount` are
> POST-default and ARE ~the recovery label; a cure/recovery model must never read them as inputs.
> **Full parametric set:** the 10 grounded recipes implementing this journey are in **§PART I** (the
> collections + deposits/ALM + payments appendix) ↔ `templates.py::COLLECTIONS_TEMPLATES`.

## B7. Deposit / liquidity / treasury (ALM) — the STABILITY spectrum
```
STABLE CORE → RATE-SENSITIVE → SURGE / HOT MONEY → RUNOFF-PRONE → OUTFLOW ⚠
```
Not a customer funnel — a **deposit-behaviour spectrum** per depositor/segment; feeds LCR/NSFR, FTP, ALM.
- **Stable core:** `nmd_stability` (low volatility, low beta), long tenure.
- **Rate-sensitive:** `deposit_beta_proxy` (`pct_change(balance)` vs benchmark-rate change).
- **Surge / hot money:** `surge_deposit_flag` (sudden large inflow, high beta), short expected life.
- **Runoff-prone:** `net_flow_trend` negative, `concentration_by_depositor` (few big depositors),
  correlated-withdrawal risk.
> Ties to B1: a depositor sliding STABLE→OUTFLOW is also churning — the deposit-attrition overlap.
> **NOT a balance re-hash:** churn already owns plain balance behaviour (`balance_trend`/
> `balance_volatility`/`days_below_threshold`) — this family's value is the ALM-distinctive treasury
> features a plain balance catalog can't ground (deposit beta, FTP/NMD life, HQLA/LCR/NSFR, repricing
> gap, maturity runoff). **Full parametric set:** the 10 grounded recipes are in **§PART I** ↔
> `templates.py::DEPOSITS_TEMPLATES`.

## B8. Markets / trading — risk families + the COUNTERPARTY-RISK funnel
Positions/instruments, not customers. **High MRM tier** (VaR/XVA models heavily governed); MNPI /
Chinese-wall aware. Time-scale: intraday→daily.
- **Sensitivity families (point-in-time):** `greek_exposure` — delta/gamma/vega/theta/rho per
  position/book (params: greek; add: additive across a book per greek; explain: H). `position_concentration`
  — HHI of exposure by issuer/sector.
- **Risk metrics:** `var_1d` / `expected_shortfall` (tail loss over horizon; explain: M), `stress_pnl`
  (P&L under a {scenario} — CCAR/EBA).
- **XVA / counterparty exposure:** `expected_exposure` (EPE) / `potential_future_exposure` (PFE) —
  exposure profile over time; `cva` (expected counterparty-default loss); `wrong_way_risk`
  (corr(exposure, counterparty PD); explain: M).
- **PnL & control:** `pnl_daily`, `pnl_volatility`, `pnl_attribution` (decompose delta/gamma/vega/carry/
  residual), `unexplained_pnl` (the residual — large ⇒ booking/model issue; a **control** signal).
- **Counterparty-risk funnel (mirrors credit):** `HEALTHY → MARGIN PRESSURE (rising PFE, margin calls) →
  DISPUTE (collateral shortfall) → CLOSE-OUT ⚠ (default)`. Trap: close-out ≈ the default label.
- **Settlement/execution:** `settlement_fail_rate`; `slippage` / `market_impact` (TCA); `fill_ratio`.
> **Full parametric set:** the 9 grounded recipes covering the market-risk measures (VaR/ES, greeks,
> notional netting, book/desk concentration, benchmark basis, trading-limit utilisation) and the
> counterparty-risk funnel (EPE/PFE trend, margin-call intensity, counterparty-deterioration EWI) are in
> **§PART J** ↔ `templates.py::MARKETS_TEMPLATES`.

## B9. Insurance / bancassurance — the LAPSE funnel + the CLAIMS-FRAUD journey
Two journeys. **Health/mortality data = special-category** → heavy consent, restricted use.
- **Lapse / persistency funnel (mirrors churn):** `ACTIVE → DISENGAGEMENT → ARREARS → SURRENDER REQUEST ⚠
  → LAPSED`. Signals: `premium_payment_regularity` (= `inter_event_gap_std` on premiums),
  `premium_arrears_flag`, `payment_method_failure`, `policy_tenure`, `surrender_value_ratio` (surrender
  value ÷ premiums — the incentive to surrender), `lapse_risk_score`. Near-label: surrender request.
- **Claims-fraud journey:** `INCEPTION → CLAIM EVENT → FILED → INVESTIGATION → SETTLE/DENY`. Signals:
  `early_claim_flag` (claim soon after inception — red flag), `claim_frequency`, `claim_amount_zscore`,
  `prior_claims_count`, `claim_network_degree` (staged-accident rings), `claim_inconsistency_score`
  (NLP over the claim narrative — derived downstream, §D.8). Near-label: confirmed-fraud/repudiation.
- **Underwriting:** `sum_assured_to_income`, `medical_disclosure_flag`, `mortality_morbidity_proxy`
  (age/health — **special-category, restricted**).
> **Full parametric set:** the 10 grounded recipes covering the lapse/persistency funnel (premium-payment
> irregularity, missed-premium streak, surrender-value trajectory, policy-loan utilisation) built from
> PRE-lapse signals (never `lapsed`/`surrendered`), the claims journey (frequency/severity + the
> near-label claims-fraud typology built from claim BEHAVIOUR, never `fraud_flag`), and reinsurance-
> recoverable concentration, sum-assured adequacy, bancassurance cross-hold + mortality/morbidity loading
> (the actuarial RATE — a health-STATUS special_category column stays engine-blocked) are in **§PART K** ↔
> `templates.py::INSURANCE_TEMPLATES`.

## B10. Custody & securities services — the SETTLEMENT-FAIL funnel
Operational / asset-servicing; institutional; operational-risk governed. Less PII.
- **Settlement-fail funnel:** `TRADE BOOKED → MATCHING (unmatched/mismatch) → PRE-SETTLEMENT
  (inventory/cash shortfall) → SETTLEMENT DATE → FAIL ⚠ → FAIL-AGING → BUY-IN`. Signals:
  `matching_break_rate`, `inventory_shortfall_flag`, `counterparty_fail_history`, `cutoff_proximity`
  (market/ccy cut-off), `settlement_fail_rate`, `fail_aging_days`. Near-label: the fail itself.
- **Corporate-action risk:** `ca_election_deadline_proximity`, `ca_complexity`, `missed_election_history`
  (missing an election = client loss).

## B11. ESG / sustainable finance — scoring + the TRANSITION-RISK journey
**ESG data is often EXTERNAL** (ratings vendors, emissions disclosures) — availability/quality caveats;
an `esg_score` is itself a model output (a derived tag, §D.8). Geographic is climate-legitimate, **not a
credit proxy**.
- **Scoring:** `esg_score` (E/S/G pillars), `esg_trend` (improving/deteriorating), `controversy_flag`.
- **Transition-risk journey:** `ALIGNED → LAGGING → HIGH-RISK → STRANDED`. Signals: `carbon_intensity`
  (emissions ÷ revenue), `sector_transition_risk` (high-carbon exposure), `transition_alignment` (vs
  net-zero pathway), `stranded_asset_exposure`.
- **Physical climate risk:** `physical_hazard_exposure` (flood/wildfire/heat of collateral/operations by
  geography). eligibility: geographic — climate-legitimate.
- **Greenwashing / SLL:** `green_proceeds_deviation` (green-bond proceeds not actually green),
  `sll_kpi_trend` / `sll_kpi_breach_flag` (triggers a margin ratchet), `esg_claim_vs_data_gap`.
> **Full parametric set:** the 9 grounded recipes covering scoring/emissions (per-scope absolute+intensity
> trend with the cross-scope double-count GUARD, carbon-intensity trajectory, PCAF financed-emissions
> attribution [attributed → additive], emissions-data-quality reliance [provenance], Scope-3 value-chain
> exposure with the cross-ENTITY double-count guard) and the transition-risk journey (taxonomy alignment,
> transition/pathway gap, physical-hazard exposure [geographic is climate-legit, not a credit proxy],
> SLL/KPI achievement) are in **§PART K** ↔ `templates.py::ESG_TEMPLATES`.

## B12. Asset management (buy-side) — the REDEMPTION funnel + mandate compliance
Funds/mandates, driven by **relative performance + liquidity**. Regulatory: IMA/mandate compliance,
open-ended fund liquidity.
- **Investor-flow / redemption funnel (mirrors churn):** `INVESTED → DISENGAGEMENT (reduced allocation) →
  REDEMPTION-RISK (underperformance, partial redemptions) → REDEMPTION NOTICE ⚠ → REDEEMED`. Signals:
  `fund_flow_trend` (net subs − redemptions), `relative_performance` (vs benchmark — underperformance
  drives outflows), `investor_concentration` (few big investors = run risk), `distribution_partner_flow`
  (platform/advisor flows), `redemption_notice_flag` (near-label).
- **Mandate / portfolio risk:** `mandate_breach_proximity` (drift toward a sector/issuer/rating limit),
  `style_drift` (portfolio vs stated style), `tracking_error`, `fund_liquidity_coverage` (liquid assets ÷
  expected redemptions — the run-risk mismatch), `concentration_vs_limit`.
> **Full parametric set:** the 8 grounded recipes covering the redemption funnel (net fund-flow trend,
> relative performance, share-class flow mix, redemption liquidity coverage, AUM stability) built from
> `fund_flow`/performance PRE-signals (never `redeemed`), plus the mandate-compliance near-label pair
> (tracking-error + mandate breach proximity) and expense-ratio competitiveness are in **§PART J** ↔
> `templates.py::ASSET_MGMT_TEMPLATES`.

## B13. Islamic banking — conventional funnels + the SHARIA-COMPLIANCE overlay
Most B1–B7 funnels APPLY (churn/credit/deposits), reframed: **profit-rate, not interest**. The
distinctive layer is **Sharia compliance = a hard eligibility gate** (like a regulatory rule), ratified
by the **Sharia board** (a domain-specific ratification, cf. Compliance).
- **Sharia-compliance features:** `sharia_compliance_flag`, `prohibited_activity_exposure` (haram-sector
  screen — alcohol/gambling/conventional-interest), `purification_amount` (non-compliant income to
  purify), `profit_rate` (replaces interest in all rate features).
- **Product-specific behavioural:** Murabaha `installment_payment_behavior` (= credit B2); Ijara
  `lease_utilisation` + residual-value risk; Mudaraba/Musharaka `profit_share_volatility` (partner
  performance); Sukuk = bond features; Takaful = insurance (B9 lapse/claims).
- **Deposit attrition:** `islamic_deposit_beta` (profit-rate sensitivity) + Sharia-compliance-concern
  churn (a distinctive driver). eligibility: Sharia non-compliance is a **HARD block**.
> **Full parametric set:** the 8 grounded recipes covering the Sharia-compliance overlay (profit-rate
> exposure, profit-sharing [Mudaraba/Musharaka] split behaviour, purification ratio, prohibited-activity
> exposure share [near-label to the compliance-breach determination], Sukuk concentration, Takaful
> contribution behaviour) and the conventional funnels reframed (Islamic deposit beta, Murabaha
> installment behaviour) — **profit-rate, not interest** — are in **§PART K** ↔
> `templates.py::ISLAMIC_TEMPLATES`.

## B14. Payments-as-a-business (beyond cards)
RTP/instant, correspondent banking, cross-border/remittance, open banking, merchant acquiring.
- **RTP / instant-payment fraud (real-time, like B3):** `app_scam_pattern` (authorised push payment —
  victim tricked: new payee + high value + urgency), `mule_inflow_pattern` (receiving side — in-then-
  straight-out), `payment_velocity`, `beneficiary_risk`. Near-label: the scam/fraud payment.
- **Correspondent banking:** `correspondent_exposure`, `nested_correspondent_flag` (respondent serving
  other banks — AML), `unusual_corridor_flow`, `sanctions_corridor_exposure`.
- **Cross-border / remittance AML:** `corridor_risk` (high-risk corridor), `structuring_remittance`,
  `agent_velocity`, `sender_receiver_network`.
- **Open banking / TPP:** `tpp_consent_anomaly`, `aggregator_scraping_flag`, `consent_scope_creep`.
  eligibility: **data-governance heavy** (consent/purpose).
- **Merchant acquiring (a churn+credit funnel):** `merchant_txn_decline` (attrition), `chargeback_rate`
  (fraud/credit), `merchant_bust_out_risk` (volume spike then vanish), `settlement_delay_risk`,
  `merchant_credit_risk` (for merchant cash advance).
> **Full parametric set:** the 10 grounded recipes covering rail/scheme throughput + mix, interchange/MDR
> economics, settlement quality (auth / chargeback / returns / timing) and corridor/cross-border are in
> **§PART I** ↔ `templates.py::PAYMENTS_TEMPLATES`. (Real-time RTP/APP-scam fraud lives in the fraud
> kill-chain §PART H; this set is the payments-as-a-business economics + operations layer.)

## B15. Corporate / SME — trade & supply-chain finance (multi-product, GROUP-level)
Corporate is **multi-product + hierarchical** — features aggregate across product families AND up the
group (§A6 `group_exposure_sum`). Cash-flow / trade-flow-based, not just financials.
- **Trade finance (LC/guarantee):** `trade_cycle_length` (issue→settlement — lengthening = stress),
  `document_discrepancy_rate`, `contingent_utilisation` (undrawn LCs being drawn = stress),
  `trade_counterparty_concentration`.
- **Invoice / receivables finance:** `invoice_dilution_rate` (unpaid/credit-noted), `debtor_concentration`,
  `dso_trend` (days-sales-outstanding rising = cash stress), `invoice_verification_gap` (fake-invoice fraud).
- **Supply-chain finance:** `anchor_buyer_dependence` (SCF program hinges on the anchor's health),
  `payment_term_extension` (buyer extending terms = stress), `program_utilisation_trend`.
- **Working capital / facility:** `facility_utilisation_trend`, `covenant_headroom` (proximity to breach),
  `overdraft_persistence` (hardcore overdraft never clearing).
- **Corporate deterioration funnel (mirrors credit, at GROUP level):** `HEALTHY → EARLY STRESS
  (utilisation↑, DSO↑, term extension) → COVENANT PRESSURE (headroom↓) → BREACH ⚠ → DEFAULT/RESTRUCTURE`.
  Signals: `combined_exposure_trend` (across products + subsidiaries), `cross_product_stress_count` (#
  product lines simultaneously stressed — a strong early-warning), `trade_flow_decline` (business slowing).
  Near-label: covenant breach for a breach-prediction target.
> **Full parametric set:** the 11 grounded recipes covering trade finance (facility utilisation & headroom,
> LC/guarantee usage & rollover), invoice/receivables finance (DSO / dilution / debtor concentration),
> supply-chain finance (anchor-buyer dependence, term extension, program utilisation), the covenant-headroom
> breach path (near-label), syndication concentration, group-exposure aggregation & single-obligor
> concentration, guarantor reliance, trade-cycle / working-capital gap, pooling-structure utilisation, and
> the cross-product stress count (early-warning) are in **§PART L** ↔ `templates.py::CORPORATE_TRADE_TEMPLATES`.
> Every recipe anchors on a NON-STRUCTURAL corporate-distinctive concept (`limit`/`limit_type`/
> `contingent_exposure`/`covenant`/`syndication_share`/`collateral_type`/`ownership_percentage`); entity
> concepts (`invoice_id`/`obligor_id`/`guarantor_id`/`pooling_structure_id`) ride as the grain, never the
> sole anchor. DSO / trade-cycle / working-capital gap are declared projections; covenant is the near-label.

# PART D — Authoring rules & safety (SME notes)

1. **PIT everywhere** — trailing windows only; never bind the target's label/source columns. The engine
   rejects a template whose grounding would touch them.
2. **Additivity honoured** — a template's `add` field drives valid roll-ups; never sum a `semi`/`non`.
3. **Currency** — any cross-currency aggregate converts to a base currency first (point-in-time fx).
4. **Eligibility** — never bind a `protected_attribute`; `geographic`/income are flagged and
   use-case-gated (credit-permitted-with-care, blocked as a proxy where fair-lending applies).
5. **Explainability** — credit/pricing (`symbolic` mode) require `explain: H` templates (monotone,
   inspectable); reject low-explainability templates for those use-cases.
6. **Scaffold-not-cage** — this library SEEDS generation; the LLM composes/adapts/extends and handles
   un-templated requests. Grow the library from curated + flywheel-approved patterns.
7. **Not proven** — these are expert-curated/conventional patterns; quality is gated by the golden set,
   never claimed as data-validated.
8. **Derived intermediates + no-data-plane matching.** Some features need a flag the raw catalog does
   NOT contain and that must be **derived** — e.g. an *own-account* flag from `name_match(customer.name,
   beneficiary_name)` (§A9). Rules: (a) the template **specifies** the derivation (method + threshold) but
   the platform **cannot run it** (no data plane) — the match executes **downstream**; here it is a
   *declared* step. (b) Such derivations are **probabilistic** (entity resolution: false-pos same-name,
   false-neg initials/order/joint-accounts) → `explain: M`, declare method+threshold, and the feature's
   quality depends on the downstream matcher. (c) Name/beneficiary matching is **PII entity-resolution** →
   consent/purpose/residency eligibility REQUIRED, not optional.
9. **The FUNNEL/journey meta-pattern (B1–B7).** Most banking targets are the end of a *process*, so signals
   stage along a journey: **early = more lead-time but noisier; late = near-certain but too late.** Two
   consequences hold in *every* domain: (a) **blend stages** — don't rely on one (a good model mixes
   lead-time and strength); (b) **the bottom of every funnel is a leakage trap** — the last-stage signal
   is *almost the label* (churn: CASS switch; credit: 90+ DPD; fraud: the cash-out txn; AML: a filed SAR;
   collections: charge-off). The 3-part leakage control must **flag/reject** these. When authoring a new
   use-case, **map its funnel first**, then place each template on it and mark the near-label tail.

# PART E — Open / to-deepen
**All 15 business lines are now drafted** at funnel/family level (B1 churn · B2 credit · B3 fraud · B4 AML ·
B5 cross-sell · B6 collections · B7 treasury · B8 markets · B9 insurance · B10 custody · B11 ESG · B12
asset-management · B13 Islamic · B14 payments · B15 corporate/trade-SCF) plus 8 cross-cutting families
(A1–A8) + relationship-outflow (A9). Remaining work is **depth, not breadth**: expand each stage's compact
signals into full parametric templates (`needs/params/pit/eligibility` schema, like §A9), starting with the
pilot use-case (retail_churn) for B2 of the build. Coverage then grows per-domain via curation + the
flywheel, not one big freeze.

---

# PART F — Appendix: `retail_churn` full parametric set (PILOT — feeds build C2 + engine B2)

The pilot templates at **executable-spec depth** — what the template engine (B2) grounds and the SME (C2)
ratifies. Each is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-construction (PIT baked in), and carries a
degrade path. Concept names match the taxonomy (§3). Templates that can't fully ground **degrade or skip**
— never silently pass a partial.

**Grounding requirements — a "churn-ready" retail catalog needs:**
| Concept role | Typical column | Required by |
|---|---|---|
| `monetary_stock` + history | `accounts.balance` snapshots over time | balance_trend, volatility, days_below |
| `as_of_date` | `accounts.snapshot_date` | every point-in-time feature |
| `monetary_flow` (+ direction) | `transactions.amount` (+ dr/cr) | inflow_outflow, rfm, salary |
| `event_timestamp` | `transactions.txn_date` | dormancy, frequency_trend, rfm |
| `customer_identifier` (entity) | `customers.customer_id` | grain of every feature |
| `category_code` (salary/DD tag) | `transactions.type` | salary_*, dd_cancellation (degrade if absent) |
| `product_holding` + open/close | `holdings.*` | product_breadth/attrition |
| `effective_date` (origination) | `customers.signup_date` | tenure |
| `outcome_label` (target) | `customers.churned` | leakage anchor (never a feature input) |

### 1 · `balance_trend_{window}` *(Stage 3 — headline drain signal)*
- **computes:** OLS slope of `{stock_col}` vs time over trailing `{window}` days per `{entity}`;
  `measure=normalized` divides slope by window-mean balance (scale-free).
- **needs:** `monetary_stock {stock_col}` **with time history** · `as_of_date` · entity `{entity}`.
- **params:** `window ∈ {30,60,90}` (def 90) · `measure ∈ {slope,normalized}` (def normalized).
- **grain:** per `{entity}` per as_of. **pit:** rows in `({asof}−{window}, {asof}]`, strictly ≤ as_of.
- **add:** n/a. **eligibility:** bind a `monetary_stock` (not flow); single currency (convert first).
  **explain:** H. **degrade:** only a *current* balance (no history) → **skip** (no trend from one point).

### 2 · `dormancy_days` *(baseline recency — ⚠ near-label)*
- **computes:** `{asof} − max({event_ts})` over `{event_ts} ≤ {asof}`. **needs:** `event_timestamp` on
  `{entity}`. **params:** `event_filter` (def: any txn). **grain/pit:** last event ≤ as_of. **add:** n/a.
  **explain:** H. **⚠ leakage:** if churn = "no activity in N days," this ≈ the label → 3-part control
  **flags** (confirm pre-as_of only, and window ≠ label window).

### 3 · `txn_frequency_trend_{window}` *(Stage 2 — engagement decay)*
- **computes:** `count(events in recent half of {window}) / count(prior half)`; `<1` = declining.
- **needs:** `event_timestamp` on `{entity}`. **params:** `window ∈ {60,90,180}` · `measure ∈
  {halves_ratio,slope}`. **grain/pit:** trailing ≤ as_of. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.

### 4 · `inflow_outflow_ratio_{window}` *(Stage 3 — net draining?)*
- **computes:** `sum(debit {amount} in window)/sum(credit {amount} in window)`; `measure=net` →
  `credits − debits`. **needs:** `monetary_flow {amount}` · a **direction** (dr/cr, or amount sign) ·
  `event_timestamp` · `{entity}`. **params:** `window` · `measure ∈ {ratio,net}`. **grain/pit:** trailing.
  **add:** `net` additive / `ratio` non-additive. **eligibility:** single currency (convert first).
  **explain:** H. **degrade:** no dr/cr flag → infer from amount sign (declared derivation, §D.8).

### 5 · `days_below_threshold_{window}` *(Stage 3 — near-empty)*
- **computes:** `count(distinct days where {stock_col} < {threshold})` in trailing window. **needs:**
  `monetary_stock` history · `as_of_date` · `{entity}`. **params:** `window` · `threshold` (absolute or a
  percentile of own history). **grain/pit:** trailing. **add:** additive (day count). **explain:** H.

### 6 · `salary_signal_{window}` *(Stage 3 — salary cessation/irregularity)*
- **computes:** over salary-tagged credits — `cessation_flag` (no salary in `{window}` when previously
  regular) · `gap_std` (std of inter-salary gaps) · `latest_gap` (days since last salary). **needs:**
  `monetary_flow` credits · **salary tag** (`category_code`) · `event_timestamp` · `{entity}`. **params:**
  `window` · `measure ∈ {cessation_flag,gap_std,latest_gap}`. **grain/pit:** trailing. **add:** n/a.
  **eligibility:** income **sensitive** — churn-permitted, flagged. **explain:** H. **degrade:** no salary
  tag → derive from recurring same-amount ~monthly credits (declared derivation §D.8; probabilistic, flag).

### 7 · `product_breadth` / `product_attrition_{window}` *(Stage 4 — unbundling)*
- **computes:** `breadth = count(distinct product_holding active at {asof})`; `attrition =
  breadth({asof}) − breadth({asof}−{window})`. **needs:** `product_holding` · open/close `effective_date`s
  · `{entity}`. **params:** `window`. **grain/pit:** products with open ≤ as_of < close. **add:** additive
  (count). **explain:** H.

### 8 · `tenure_days` *(context)*
- **computes:** `{asof} − {origination_date}`. **needs:** `effective_date` (signup) · `as_of_date` ·
  `{entity}`. **grain/pit:** origination ≤ as_of. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.

### 9 · `balance_volatility_{window}` *(Stage 3 — instability)*
- **computes:** `std({stock_col} in window) / mean({stock_col} in window)` (coeff. of variation).
  **needs:** `monetary_stock` history · `as_of_date` · `{entity}`. **params:** `window`. **grain/pit:**
  trailing. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.

### 10 · `rfm_composite` *(baseline workhorse)*
- **computes:** percentile-binned blend of `recency_days`, `txn_frequency({window})`,
  `monetary_sum({window})`. **needs:** `event_timestamp` · `monetary_flow` · `{entity}`. **params:**
  `window`. **grain/pit:** trailing. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H (components inspectable).

### 11 · `dd_cancellation_rate_{window}` *(Stage 4 — sticky commitments leaving)*
- **computes:** `count(DD mandates cancelled in window) / count(DDs active at window start)`. **needs:**
  `direct_debit` mandate events (setup/cancel) · `event_timestamp` · `{entity}`. **params:** `window`.
  **grain/pit:** trailing. **add:** non-additive (rate). **explain:** H. **degrade:** **skip** if no
  DD/mandate data.

### 12 · `external_own_transfer_trend` *(Stage 3 — primacy loss)*
- Fully specified in **§A9** (own-account flag via `name_match`, downstream + PII). Included for banks with
  beneficiary + name data; **degrade** to `external_outflow_growth` if no name to match.

**Composite (optional, not MVP):** `relationship_erosion_score` blends 1–12 by lead-time × strength;
`explain: H` (shows which fired).

**Build note (C2/B2):** these 12 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model — `needs`→grounding contract,
`params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window guard, `degrade`→fallback. The pilot **golden set**
(kick-off) should exercise each of 1–12 **plus** the `dormancy_days` near-label flag and the
`dd_cancellation` / `external_own_transfer` degrade paths.

# PART G — Appendix: `credit_risk` full parametric set (implements §B2)

The §B2 **deterioration → default** funnel authored to Part-F depth — the 16 recipes the template engine
(B2) grounds, in `templates.py::CREDIT_RISK_TEMPLATES` (the family joins `ALL_TEMPLATES`, the registry
gate1 grounds). Each is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-construction (PIT baked in), and carries a
degrade path. Concept names match the taxonomy (§3).

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule):** every recipe **requires ≥1 credit-distinctive concept**
(`limit`/`ead`/`dpd`/`delinquency_bucket`/`ecl`/`impairment_stage`/`collateral_value`/`bureau_*`/
`trade_line`/`restructured_flag`/`sicr_flag`/`covenant`/`scheduled_amount`), so **grounding is the router**
— the family surfaces ONLY where the catalog carries credit signals; a churn/deposit catalog grounds
**nothing** here. No recipe ever `Need`s a leakage anchor (`default_flag`/`delinquency_flag`); the engine
refuses them by construction.

**Near-label discipline:** a recipe that binds a near-label concept (or a DPD level / covenant breach that
borders the default event) sets `near_label=True` + a ⚠ eligibility note — the deterioration must be
observed **strictly pre-default** (window ≠ the label window) and the 3-part leakage control must **flag**
it. **Fair-lending:** no recipe binds a `protected_attribute` (engine-enforced); income/geo flagged.

**Grounding requirements — a "credit-ready" facility catalog needs:**
| Concept role | Typical column | Required by |
|---|---|---|
| `facility_id` (grain) / `customer_id` | `facilities.facility_id` / `.customer_id` | grain of every feature; bureau on customer |
| `as_of_date` | `facilities.as_of_dt` | every point-in-time state feature |
| `limit` + `monetary_stock` (drawn) | `facilities.credit_limit` + `.drawn_balance` | credit_utilisation, payment_ratio, min_payment_only |
| `ead` (exposure) | `facilities.ead` | exposure_trend (+ LTV numerator alt) |
| `dpd` / `delinquency_bucket` | `facilities.dpd` / `.delinquency_bucket` | days_past_due_max / delinquency_bucket_dynamics |
| `ecl` / `impairment_stage` | `facilities.ecl` / `.impairment_stage` | ecl_provision_trend / stage_migration |
| `collateral_value` | `facilities.collateral_value` | loan_to_value |
| `scheduled_amount` + `monetary_flow` | `payments.scheduled_amount` + `.amount` | missed_partial_payment_count, payment_ratio |
| `event_timestamp` | `payments.payment_ts` | repayment + bureau-velocity windows |
| `bureau_score`/`bureau_inquiry`/`trade_line` | `bureau.*` (FCRA external) | bureau_score_delta / inquiry_velocity / new_tradeline |
| `restructured_flag`/`sicr_flag`/`covenant` | `facilities.*` | forbearance / sicr_onset / dscr_covenant_headroom |
| `default_flag` (target) | `facilities.default_flag` | leakage anchor (never a feature input) |

### Utilisation & exposure — Stage 1 (early stress)
1. **`credit_utilisation_{window}`** — drawn / `limit` (`measure=level`) or its trailing OLS trend
   (`measure=trend`). **needs:** `limit` · `monetary_stock` (drawn) · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`.
   **params:** `window∈{90,60,30}` · `measure∈{level,trend}`. **add:** non_additive (level=ratio;
   trend=n/a). **explain:** H. **degrade:** no limit → **skip** (use `exposure_trend`).
2. **`exposure_trend_{window}`** — OLS slope of `ead` over the window (limit-free; term loans + committed
   lines). **needs:** `ead` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{180,90,365}` ·
   `measure∈{normalized,slope}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H. **degrade:** single snapshot → **skip**.
   *`contingent_exposure` is an alternate for the undrawn line.*

### Arrears / DPD dynamics — Stage 3 (delinquency) ⚠ near-label
3. **`days_past_due_max_{window}`** — `max(dpd)` in the window. **needs:** `dpd` · `as_of_date` ·
   `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{90,60,30}` · `measure∈{max,latest}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.
   **⚠ near-label:** a max DPD → 90+ IS the Basel default backstop; observe strictly pre-default.
4. **`delinquency_bucket_dynamics_{window}`** — worst bucket reached (`measure=worst_bucket`) or forward
   roll (`measure=roll_rate`). **needs:** `delinquency_bucket` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`.
   **params:** `window∈{90,60,30}` · `measure∈{worst_bucket,roll_rate}`. **add:** n/a (worst_bucket
   ordinal; roll_rate=non-additive). **explain:** H. **⚠ near-label** (90+ bucket = default backstop).

### Repayment behaviour — Stage 2 (emerging distress)
5. **`payment_ratio_{window}`** — Σ(repayment) / drawn (`measure=to_balance`) or / `limit`
   (`measure=to_limit`); falling = distress. **needs:** `monetary_flow` · `monetary_stock` · `limit` ·
   `event_timestamp` · `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{90,60,180}` · `measure∈{to_balance,to_limit}`.
   **add:** non_additive (ratio). **explain:** H. **degrade:** no limit → **skip**.
6. **`min_payment_only_streak_{window}`** — consecutive periods paying only ~the minimum (≈`{min_pct}`% of
   balance/limit). **needs:** `monetary_flow` · `limit` · `event_timestamp` · `facility_id`. **params:**
   `window∈{180,90,365}` · `min_pct∈{3,5,2}`. **add:** additive (period count). **explain:** H.
   **derived:** `is_min_only := payment ≤ min_due` — declared downstream (§D.8), probabilistic → FLAG.
7. **`missed_partial_payment_count_{window}`** — count of installments where paid < due. **needs:**
   `scheduled_amount` · `monetary_flow` (paid) · `event_timestamp` · `facility_id`. **params:**
   `window∈{180,90,365}` · `tolerance_pct∈{5,0,10}`. **add:** additive (count). **explain:** H.
   **degrade:** revolving product (no schedule) → **skip** (use `payment_ratio`). *anchor `scheduled_amount`
   is lending-specific (not on the §B2 distinctive list) — absent from a deposit/churn catalog, so it
   still routes.*

### Exposure & provisioning drift — Stage 2 (staging is ⚠ near-label)
8. **`ecl_provision_trend_{window}`** — trend in the IFRS9 ECL provision. **needs:** `ecl` · `as_of_date` ·
   `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{180,90,365}` · `measure∈{slope,pct_change}`. **add:** n/a.
   **explain:** H. **degrade:** single snapshot → **skip**. *`provision_amount` is an alternate.*
9. **`stage_migration_{window}`** — IFRS9 stage worse at as_of than at window start (`measure=worsened_flag
   /stage_delta`). **needs:** `impairment_stage` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **params:**
   `window∈{180,90,365}` · `measure∈{worsened_flag,stage_delta}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.
   **⚠ near-label:** stage 3 = credit-impaired ≈ the default label.

### Collateral — Stage 1 (early stress)
10. **`loan_to_value_{window}`** — exposure / `collateral_value` (`ltv`), inverse (`coverage`), or uncovered
    `shortfall`. **needs:** `monetary_stock` (exposure) · `collateral_value` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`.
    **params:** `window∈{90,180,365}` · `measure∈{ltv,coverage,shortfall}`. **add:** non_additive
    (ltv/coverage=ratio; shortfall=amount). **explain:** H. **degrade:** unsecured → **skip**. *apply
    haircut/advance_rate first; `ead` is an alternate numerator.*

### Bureau / external — Stage 2 (FCRA external, provenance-flagged)
11. **`bureau_score_delta_{window}`** — change in external bureau score. **needs:** `bureau_score` ·
    `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **params:** `window∈{90,180,365}` · `measure∈{delta,slope}`. **add:** n/a.
    **explain:** H. **eligibility:** FCRA external + **MODEL OUTPUT → leakage-risk, flag**. **degrade:**
    single pull → **skip**.
12. **`bureau_inquiry_velocity_{window}`** — count of HARD inquiries. **needs:** `bureau_inquiry` ·

    · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:** `window∈{180,90,365}`. **add:** additive (count).
    **explain:** H. **eligibility:** FCRA external.

### Forbearance / SICR — Stage 2-4 ⚠ near-label
14. **`forbearance_in_window_{window}`** — a restructure/concession occurred (`measure=occurred_flag/
    count`). **needs:** `restructured_flag` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{365,180,
    90}` · `measure∈{occurred_flag,count}`. **add:** n/a (flag; count=additive). **explain:** H.
    **⚠ near-label:** forbearance ≈ the impaired/default label (IFRS9 Stage-3 trigger).
15. **`sicr_onset_{window}`** — an IFRS9 SICR trigger fired (Stage 1→2). **needs:** `sicr_flag` ·
    `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{180,90,365}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.
    **⚠ near-label:** the staging trigger borders the default funnel.

### Affordability — covenant / DSCR ⚠ near-label
16. **`dscr_covenant_headroom_{window}`** — margin between a covenant's actual and threshold (DSCR/ICR/
    leverage); shrinking/negative = breach path (`measure=headroom/breached_flag/trend`). **needs:**
    `covenant` · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **params:** `window∈{90,180,365}` · `measure∈{headroom,
    breached_flag,trend}`. **add:** non_additive (headroom=ratio; breached_flag=n/a). **explain:** H.
    **⚠ near-label:** a breach borders the default/forbearance label; income inputs are SENSITIVE.

**Build note (B2):** these 16 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F — `needs`→grounding
contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/state guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise:
`days_past_due_max`, `delinquency_bucket_dynamics`, `stage_migration`, `forbearance_in_window`,
`sicr_onset`, `dscr_covenant_headroom`. Routing is verified by `test_templates_credit.py` (the family
grounds nothing on the churn catalog; `ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn yields exactly the churn lens).

# PART H — Appendix: fraud + AML full parametric sets (implements §B3 + §B4)

The §B3 **fraud KILL-CHAIN** (11 recipes, `templates.py::FRAUD_TEMPLATES`) and the §B4 **AML LAUNDERING
cycle** (11 recipes, `templates.py::AML_TEMPLATES`) authored to Part-F/G depth — the recipes the template
engine grounds; both families join `ALL_TEMPLATES`, which gate1 grounds. Each is groundable by
concept-matching, safe-by-construction (PIT baked in), and carries a degrade path. Concept names match the
taxonomy (§3).

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule — sharper than §B2's).** Grounding is the router, so a family
surfaces ONLY where the catalog carries its crime signals. But an *entity* concept (`card_id`,
`merchant_id`, `counterparty_id`, `alert_id`, `case_id`, `wallet_address`) gets **structural `is_grain`
credit** in the engine's matcher — it would bind ANY grain column, cross-surfacing the family onto a plain
churn catalog. So every recipe REQUIRES at least one crime-distinctive **NON-STRUCTURAL** concept — a
categorical signal (`payment_rail`/`scheme`/`corridor`/`country_code`/`mcc`/`iso20022_purpose_code`/
`debit_credit_indicator`/`nostro_vostro`), a pii behavioural (`device_fingerprint`/`geolocation`), or a
screening flag (`pep_flag`/`sanctions_hit_flag`/`adverse_media_flag`/`watchlist_hit_flag`) — that binds
**only by exact concept match**. This holds the locked invariant, asserted by `test_templates_crime.py` +
`test_templates_credit.py`: **`ALL_TEMPLATES` grounded on the churn `_CATALOG` yields EXACTLY the churn
lens** (the churn catalog even carries generic `beneficiary_name`/`beneficiary_bank`, so those are NOT
sufficient anchors). No recipe ever `Need`s the `fraud_flag` leakage anchor; the engine refuses it by
construction.

**Leakage / near-label discipline.** A monitoring feature is built from the **BEHAVIOUR** (velocity,
geo-impossibility, structuring, cash intensity), NEVER from the alert outcome. Fraud recipes are therefore
NOT near-label (the fraudulent txn *is* often the label, but the velocity/anomaly is observed strictly
pre-decision). The near-label tail lives in AML: a **screening-exposure** or **prior-alert** recipe borders
the label → `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note — observe the exposure **strictly before** the alert; a filed SAR
/ confirmed screening hit is the LABEL, never an input. **PII:** `device_fingerprint`, `geolocation`,
`pep_flag`, `sanctions_hit_flag`, `adverse_media_flag`, `wallet_address` are pii → read-scoped (need the
pii role) + consent/purpose/residency. **Proxy:** `corridor`/`country_code` are national-origin proxies
(fair-lending) — AML-permitted but bias-watched, never a credit input. **Fair-lending:** no recipe binds a
`protected_attribute` (engine-enforced).

**Fraud is REAL-TIME.** Windows are MINUTES/HOURS (a `window_min` param, NOT a trailing-days `window` — the
`_{window}d` naming would mis-label minutes as days), computed on the live PRE-transaction state; the
declaration is design-time (there is no data plane, and a batch trailing-window model cannot honour
real-time settlement-finality timing). AML windows are trailing DAYS/weeks (typology cadence, a `window`
param). No data plane enforces either PIT rule — the declaration travels with the candidate.

**Grounding requirements — a "crime-ready" transaction-monitoring catalog needs:**
| Concept role | Typical column | Required by |
|---|---|---|
| `customer_id`/`card_id`/`merchant_id` (grain) | `customers.customer_id` / `cards.card_id` / `merchants.merchant_id` | grain of every feature |
| `monetary_flow` + `event_timestamp` | `txns.amount` + `.txn_ts` | every velocity / amount / structuring feature |
| `device_fingerprint` / `geolocation` (pii) | `txns.device_fp` / `.geo` | device_sharing, new_device, geo_velocity_impossible |
| `payment_rail` / `scheme` | `txns.rail` | card_testing, txn_velocity, cross_rail, first_time_payee, just_under_limit |
| `mcc` | `txns.mcc` | merchant_risk_anomaly |
| `corridor` / `country_code` (proxy) | `txns.corridor` | cross_border_burst, high_risk_corridor_exposure |
| `beneficiary_bank` | `txns.beneficiary_bank` | first_time_payee_high_value, rapid_movement (opt) |
| `debit_credit_indicator` | `txns.dr_cr` | structuring, rapid_movement, fan_in_fan_out, dormant_reactivation |
| `iso20022_purpose_code` | `txns.purpose` | cash_intensity_ratio, round_amount_ratio |
| `counterparty_id` | `txns.counterparty_id` | fan_in_fan_out |
| `nostro_vostro`/`swift_message_type`/`nested_correspondent_flag` | `correspondent.*` | nested_correspondent_flow |
| `on_chain_txn`/`wallet_address`/`stablecoin` | `crypto.*` | crypto_offramp_exposure |
| `pep_flag`/`sanctions_hit_flag`/`adverse_media_flag`/`watchlist_hit_flag` | `kyc.*` | screening_exposure, prior_alert_recidivism |
| `fraud_flag` (target) | `txns.fraud_flag` | leakage anchor (never a feature input) |

   `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp`. **params:** `measure∈{high_risk_mcc_share,novel_merchant_flag}`.

### CASH-OUT — Stage 4 (built from behaviour, NOT the `fraud_flag`)
7. **`txn_velocity_spike`** — count/amount in a short window vs the entity's own baseline. **needs:**

8. **`amount_zscore_spike`** — z-score of an amount vs the entity's own mean/std. **needs:**

9. **`cross_channel_rail_anomaly`** — first use of a `payment_rail`/`scheme` the entity never uses.
   **needs:** `payment_rail` · `scheme` (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a.

    *anchor `corridor` (proxy — bias-watched).*
11. **`amount_just_under_limit`** — share of payments just below a rail's reporting/SCA threshold. **needs:**
    `payment_rail` · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:** `band_pct∈{5,2,10}`.

## AML — the LAUNDERING cycle (`AML_TEMPLATES`, typology-driven)

### PLACEMENT (dirty money enters)
1. **`structuring_smurfing`** — count of sub-threshold CREDITS just below a reporting threshold (smurfing).
   **needs:** `debit_credit_indicator` · `iso20022_purpose_code` (opt) · `monetary_flow` ·

   `measure∈{value_share,count_share}`. **add:** non_additive (share). **explain:** H.

### LAYERING (obscure the trail)
3. **`rapid_movement_passthrough`** — inflow ≈ outflow within a short dwell (pass-through / funnel).
   **needs:** `debit_credit_indicator` · `beneficiary_bank` (opt) · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` ·

   amount mod {round_base} == 0`.
5. **`fan_in_fan_out`** — abnormal number of distinct counterparties in→out (mule ring / network hub).

   **add:** non_additive (degree). **explain:** M. *anchor `debit_credit_indicator` — `counterparty_id` is
   an ENTITY concept (would structurally bind any grain), so it can't be the sole anchor.*
6. **`high_risk_corridor_exposure`** — value/share of cross-border flow into high-risk corridors. **needs:**
   `corridor` · `country_code` (opt) · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:**
   `measure∈{value_share,amount}`. **add:** non_additive (share; amount=additive). **explain:** H. *anchor
   `corridor` (proxy — bias-watched).*
7. **`nested_correspondent_flow`** — payments cleared via a nested downstream correspondent (FATF/Wolfsberg
   visibility-gap typology). **needs:** `nostro_vostro` · `nested_correspondent_flag` (opt) ·
   `swift_message_type` (opt) · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp`. **params:**
   `measure∈{nested_share,occurred_flag}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** M. **degrade:** no correspondent data

8. **`crypto_offramp_exposure`** — share of flow crossing into on-chain wallets / stablecoins (fiat↔crypto
   ramps). **needs:** `on_chain_txn` · `wallet_address` (opt, pii) · `stablecoin` (opt) · `monetary_flow` ·
   `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (share; count=additive). **explain:** M.
   *`wallet_address` is FATF travel-rule PERSONAL data — read-scoped when bound.*

### INTEGRATION (clean money returns) + cross-cutting screening
9. **`dormant_reactivation`** — long-dormant account suddenly receiving large credits (parked mule/shell).
   **needs:** `debit_credit_indicator` · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:**
   `dormancy_days∈{90,60,180}`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H. **derived:** `is_reactivation := no activity
   ≥{dormancy_days}d then a large credit`.
10. **`screening_exposure`** ⚠ **near-label** — PEP/sanctions/adverse-media exposure over the customer +
    counterparties. **needs:** `pep_flag` (pii) · `sanctions_hit_flag` (opt) · `adverse_media_flag` (opt) ·
    `watchlist_hit_flag` (opt) · `customer_id`. **params:** `measure∈{exposed_flag,exposure_share}`.
    **add:** n/a. **explain:** H. **⚠ near-label + PII:** observe strictly pre-alert; a filed SAR /
    confirmed hit is the LABEL, never an input; read-scoped (pii role).
11. **`prior_alert_recidivism`** ⚠ **near-label** — count/recency of PRIOR monitoring alerts that hit a
    watchlist on this entity. **needs:** `watchlist_hit_flag` · `alert_id` (opt) · `case_id` (opt) ·
    `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:** `measure∈{prior_alert_count,days_since_last}`. **add:**
    additive (count). **explain:** M. **⚠ near-label:** only the FACT/TIMING of a prior alert — the
    SAR/filing OUTCOME is never an input. *anchor `watchlist_hit_flag` — `alert_id`/`case_id` are ENTITY
    concepts (would structurally bind any grain), so they are optional, not the routing anchor.*

**Concept substitutions (vs the §B3/§B4 designs).** None invented — every `Need` binds a real §3 concept.
Notable design-forced choices, noted on each template: (a) fraud windows use a `window_min` param (not
`window`) so the engine's `_{window}d` naming does not mis-label minutes as days; (b) recipes whose natural
signal is an *entity* concept (`card_testing`/`txn_velocity`/`merchant_risk`/`fan_in_fan_out`/
`prior_alert_recidivism`) additionally REQUIRE a non-structural anchor (`payment_rail`/`mcc`/
`debit_credit_indicator`/`watchlist_hit_flag`) to route correctly; (c) `merchant_risk_anomaly` anchors on
`mcc` (the §B3 "MCC-anomaly" signal) rather than a bare `merchant_id`; (d) `dormant_reactivation` anchors on
`debit_credit_indicator` (to see the inbound credit) because bare dormancy is generic event/entity and would
cross-surface.

**Build note (B3/B4).** These 22 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F/G — `needs`→
grounding contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/real-time guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise: `screening_exposure`,
`prior_alert_recidivism`. Routing + safety are verified by `test_templates_crime.py`: both families ground a
healthy subset of a crime-shaped catalog (with the pii role for the pii-anchored recipes), the engine NEVER
binds `fraud_flag` or a protected column, and neither family grounds anything on the churn catalog
(`ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn still yields exactly the churn lens).

---

# PART I — Appendix: collections + deposits/ALM + payments full parametric sets (implements §B6 + §B7 + §B14)

The §B6 **collections/recoveries journey** (10 recipes, `templates.py::COLLECTIONS_TEMPLATES`), the §B7
**deposit/liquidity/treasury ALM stability spectrum** (10 recipes, `templates.py::DEPOSITS_TEMPLATES`) and
the §B14 **payments-as-a-business** set (10 recipes, `templates.py::PAYMENTS_TEMPLATES`) authored to
Part-F/G/H depth — the recipes the template engine grounds; all three families join `ALL_TEMPLATES`, which
gate1 grounds. This completes the core-areas-first mandate (churn · credit · fraud · AML · **collections ·
deposits · payments** now at full parametric depth). Each is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-
construction (PIT baked in), and carries a degrade path. Concept names match the taxonomy (§3).

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule — the locked churn=churn-lens invariant).** Grounding is the
router, so a family surfaces ONLY where its distinctive concepts exist. An *entity* concept (`customer_id`,
`case_id`, `merchant_id`) gets **structural `is_grain` credit** in the matcher — it would bind ANY grain
column, cross-surfacing onto a plain churn catalog. So every recipe REQUIRES at least one domain-distinctive
**NON-STRUCTURAL** concept that binds only by exact concept match:
- **collections:** `delinquency_bucket` / `dpd` / `scheduled_amount` / `cost_to_collect` /
  `restructured_flag` / `recovery_amount` / `write_off_amount`;
- **deposits/ALM:** `benchmark_rate` / `ftp_rate` / `wholesale_funding` / `maturity_date` / `tenor` /
  `hqla` / `lcr` / `nsfr` / `repricing_gap` / `beta` (NOT plain `monetary_stock` — churn already owns
  balance behaviour, and a plain balance concentration WOULD cross-surface, so `rate_sensitive_concentration`
  weights by deposit `beta` precisely to keep its anchor distinctive);
- **payments:** `payment_rail` / `scheme` / `interchange` / `merchant_discount_rate` / `settlement_status`
  / `settlement_cycle` / `direct_debit` / `corridor` / `iso20022_purpose_code`.

This holds the locked invariant, asserted by `test_templates_core3.py`: **`ALL_TEMPLATES` grounded on the
churn `_CATALOG` yields EXACTLY the churn lens** (each new family grounds nothing there). Payments recipes
DO also ground on the fraud/AML crime catalog (shared `payment_rail`/`corridor`/`scheme`) — expected overlap
that breaks no crime test (those assert per-family grounding, never that `ALL_TEMPLATES` on the crime catalog
is only fraud+AML). No recipe ever `Need`s a leakage anchor (`default_flag`/`outcome_label`/`fraud_flag`);
the engine refuses them by construction.

**Near-label / leakage discipline.** Collections carries the near-label tail (bucket/DPD rolls, forbearance,
and — hardest — POST-charge-off recoveries): `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly BEFORE the
cure/recovery/charge-off outcome). The **recovery/write-off** recipes carry an EXTRA hard flag —
`recovery_amount`/`write_off_amount` are POST-default and ARE ~the recovery label, so a cure/recovery model
must NEVER read them as an input (bind ONLY for a downstream post-default LGD/severity study). Deposits and
payments are NOT near-label (a treasury signal / a payments-throughput/economics signal does not border a
customer outcome). **Conduct:** collections flags the FCA Consumer-Duty `vulnerability_flag`
(special-category, engine-blocked as a feature input — segment on it downstream under an eligibility gate).
**Proxy:** payments `corridor`/`country_code` are national-origin proxies (fair-lending) — payments/AML-
permitted but bias-watched, never a credit input.

## Collections & recoveries — the DELINQUENCY → RECOVERY journey (`COLLECTIONS_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — a "collections-ready" catalog needs:** `customer_id` (grain) · `as_of_date` ·
`monetary_stock` (balance-at-risk) · `monetary_flow` (paid) + `event_timestamp` · `scheduled_amount`
(installment DUE) · `dpd` / `delinquency_bucket` (arrears) · `restructured_flag` (forbearance) ·
`cost_to_collect` · `recovery_amount` / `write_off_amount` (post-charge-off) · plus the `outcome_label`
target (leakage anchor — never a feature input).

### EARLY (1–29 DPD) — promise / arrangement behaviour
1. **`promise_to_pay_adherence_{window}`** — share of the promised/scheduled amount PAID while delinquent.
   **needs:** `scheduled_amount` · `monetary_flow` (paid) · `dpd` (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`.
   **params:** `window∈{90,60,180}` · `tolerance_pct∈{5,0,10}`. **add:** non_additive (ratio). **explain:** H.
   *anchor `scheduled_amount`; concept sub: no promise_to_pay concept — scheduled_amount is the promised due.*
2. **`payment_plan_adherence_{window}`** — consecutive arrangement installments met on time (kept-plan
   streak). **needs:** `scheduled_amount` · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:**
   `window∈{180,90,365}` · `tolerance_pct∈{5,0,10}`. **add:** additive (count). **explain:** H.

### MID (30–89 DPD) — roll dynamics + contactability
3. **`cure_reage_dynamics_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — did the `delinquency_bucket` roll BACK (self-cure /
   re-age)? `measure=cure_flag/bucket_improvement`. **needs:** `delinquency_bucket` · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H. **⚠ near-label:** a cure IS the collections outcome state.
4. **`roll_forward_severity_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — did DPD WORSEN (`max(dpd)` vs window start)?
   `measure=roll_forward_flag/dpd_delta`. **needs:** `dpd` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a.
   **⚠ near-label:** a DPD rolling to 90+ IS the charge-off backstop.
5. **`right_party_contact_intensity_{window}`** — rate/volume of successful collections contacts.
   **needs:** `cost_to_collect` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **params:** `measure∈{rpc_rate,
   attempt_count}`. **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive). **explain:** M. *anchor `cost_to_collect`;
   **concept sub:** the taxonomy has NO contact-event / right-party-contact concept — cost_to_collect is the
   distinctive anchor and the contact event is a declared downstream derivation.*

### LATE (90+ DPD) — tenure, hardship, cost
6. **`days_in_collection_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — `as_of − first-delinquent-bucket date` (how long
   worked). **needs:** `delinquency_bucket` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a. **explain:** H.
7. **`hardship_forbearance_in_collection_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — a concession (holiday / re-age /
   restructure) while delinquent (`measure=occurred_flag/count`). **needs:** `restructured_flag` ·
   `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a (flag; count=additive). **explain:** H.
8. **`cost_to_collect_ratio_{window}`** — collections cost vs balance-at-risk (`measure=to_balance/absolute`).
   **needs:** `cost_to_collect` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive
   (ratio; absolute=additive). **explain:** H. *survivorship — cost_to_collect only exists for worked accounts.*

### RECOVERY / CHARGE-OFF ⚠⚠ POST-DEFAULT (hard leakage flag)
9. **`recovery_rate_{window}`** ⚠⚠ **near-label** — post-charge-off `recovery_amount` vs the defaulted
   balance (the LGD complement; `measure=to_defaulted_balance/cumulative_amount`). **needs:**
   `recovery_amount` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (ratio;
   cumulative=additive). **⚠⚠ a cure/recovery model must NEVER read recovery_amount as an INPUT — it IS
   ~the recovery label;** bind ONLY for a downstream post-default LGD/severity study.
10. **`write_off_severity_{window}`** ⚠⚠ **near-label** — `write_off_amount` charged off vs exposure at
    charge-off (`measure=to_exposure/amount`). **needs:** `write_off_amount` · `monetary_stock` ·
    `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (ratio; amount=additive). **⚠⚠ the charge-off IS
    the label event — features from write_off_amount leak it;** bind ONLY for a downstream loss study.

## Deposit / liquidity / treasury ALM — the STABILITY spectrum (`DEPOSITS_TEMPLATES`)

**NOT a balance re-hash** — churn already owns `balance_trend`/`balance_volatility`/`days_below_threshold`;
this family's value is the ALM-distinctive treasury features a plain balance catalog cannot ground.
**Grounding requirements — a "treasury-ready" catalog needs:** `customer_id` (depositor grain) ·
`as_of_date` · `monetary_stock` (balance) · the ALM anchors `benchmark_rate` · `ftp_rate` ·
`wholesale_funding` · `maturity_date` · `tenor` · `hqla` · `lcr` · `nsfr` · `repricing_gap` · `beta`.

### STABLE CORE — sticky funding + liquidity contribution
1. **`nmd_stickiness_{window}`** — non-maturity-deposit behavioural life priced by its `ftp_rate` curve
   (`measure=ftp_tenor_proxy/decay_rate`). **needs:** `ftp_rate` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. **explain:** M. *anchor `ftp_rate`.*
2. **`hqla_eligibility_contribution_{window}`** — the HQLA amount a deposit backs / its net outflow against
   the LCR buffer (`measure=hqla_amount/net_outflow_contribution`). **needs:** `hqla` · `lcr` (opt) ·
   `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** semi_additive (amount stock). **explain:** H.
3. **`nsfr_asf_contribution_{window}`** — the available-stable-funding a deposit provides (ASF factor ×
   balance; `measure=nsfr_ratio/asf_amount`). **needs:** `nsfr` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (ratio; asf_amount=semi). **explain:** H.

### RATE-SENSITIVE — deposit beta, LCR outflow weight, repricing gap
4. **`deposit_beta_{window}`** — balance/rate response vs a reference `benchmark_rate` (`measure=rate_beta/
   balance_beta`). **needs:** `benchmark_rate` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **params:**
   `window∈{365,180,90}`. **add:** non_additive (beta). **explain:** H. **degrade:** single snapshot → skip.
5. **`lcr_outflow_weight_{window}`** — the deposit's modelled 30-day net-cash-outflow RATE (LCR runoff
   factor). **needs:** `lcr` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (ratio).
6. **`repricing_gap_exposure_{window}`** — the net IRRBB repricing/maturity gap the book carries
   (`measure=gap_level/gap_trend`). **needs:** `repricing_gap` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:**
   non_additive (nets within a snapshot; never sum across dates). **explain:** H.

### SURGE / HOT MONEY — non-core funding share + concentration
7. **`hot_money_share_{window}`** — share of the funding base that is non-core `wholesale_funding`
   (`measure=value_share/surge_flag`). **needs:** `wholesale_funding` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (share; flag=n/a). **explain:** H.
8. **`rate_sensitive_concentration_{window}`** — HHI of balance WEIGHTED by deposit `beta`
   (`measure=beta_weighted_hhi/top_depositor_share`). **needs:** `beta` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. **explain:** M. *the beta weighting is load-bearing for routing — a
   plain balance concentration WOULD cross-surface (monetary_stock + customer_id exist on churn).*

### RUNOFF-PRONE — maturity laddering + early-break behaviour
9. **`maturity_ladder_runoff`** — term-deposit balance/share maturing inside a `horizon_days` bucket keyed on
   `maturity_date` (`measure=runoff_share/runoff_amount`). **needs:** `maturity_date` · `monetary_stock` ·
   `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **params:** `horizon_days∈{30,90,365}`. **add:** non_additive (share;
   amount=semi). **explain:** H.
10. **`early_withdrawal_break_{window}`** — rate at which term deposits are broken before their contractual
    `tenor` (`measure=break_rate/break_count`). **needs:** `tenor` · `monetary_stock` · `as_of_date` ·
    `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive). *concept sub: no notice_period concept — a
    notice-period deposit substitutes its notice term for `tenor`.*

## Payments-as-a-business (`PAYMENTS_TEMPLATES`)

Rail/scheme throughput + mix, interchange/MDR economics, settlement quality and corridor/cross-border — the
economics + operations layer (real-time RTP/APP-scam fraud lives in the §PART H kill-chain). Additivity:
economics amounts additive, rates non-additive, mix/diversity n/a. **Grounding requirements — a
"payments-ready" catalog needs:** `customer_id` (grain) · `monetary_flow` + `event_timestamp` ·
`payment_rail` · `scheme` · `interchange` · `merchant_discount_rate` · `settlement_status` ·
`settlement_cycle` · `direct_debit` / `standing_order` · `corridor` / `country_code` ·
`iso20022_purpose_code` · plus the `fraud_flag` target (leakage anchor — never a feature input).

### THROUGHPUT & MIX
1. **`rail_volume_value_{window}`** — count/summed value of payments by `payment_rail` (`measure=value/
   count`). **needs:** `payment_rail` · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** additive.
2. **`rail_scheme_diversity_{window}`** — distinct rails/schemes used + mix concentration (`measure=
   distinct_count/hhi`). **needs:** `payment_rail` · `scheme` (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`.
   **add:** n/a.
3. **`purpose_code_diversity_{window}`** — distinct ISO-20022 purpose codes + HHI (`measure=distinct_count/
   hhi`). **needs:** `iso20022_purpose_code` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a.

### ECONOMICS
4. **`interchange_revenue_{window}`** — issuer interchange earned (`measure=sum/avg_per_txn`). **needs:**
   `interchange` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** additive (sum; avg=n/a). *economics flow.*
5. **`merchant_discount_economics_{window}`** — effective `merchant_discount_rate` (MDR) + trend
   (`measure=level/trend`). **needs:** `merchant_discount_rate` · `monetary_flow` (opt) · `event_timestamp` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate).

### SETTLEMENT QUALITY
6. **`authorisation_decline_rate_{window}`** — share settling vs declined/failed from `settlement_status`
   (`measure=decline_rate/approval_rate`). **needs:** `settlement_status` · `event_timestamp` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate).
7. **`chargeback_dispute_rate_{window}`** — share of card txns charged back/disputed under the `scheme`'s
   rules (`measure=count_rate/value_rate`). **needs:** `scheme` · `monetary_flow` (opt) · `event_timestamp` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. *concept sub: no chargeback concept — the dispute event is a declared
   downstream derivation scoped by the card scheme.*
8. **`return_payment_rate_{window}`** — share of `direct_debit` collections (or standing orders) RETURNED
   unpaid (`measure=return_rate/return_count`). **needs:** `direct_debit` · `standing_order` (opt) ·
   `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive).
9. **`settlement_lag_{window}`** — mean settlement lag vs the `settlement_cycle` (T+n) convention + late
   share (`measure=mean_lag_days/late_share`). **needs:** `settlement_cycle` · `event_timestamp` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** n/a (lag=duration; late_share=non-additive). **PIT-critical:** a fail is not
   knowable until T+n — honour system_time.

### CROSS-BORDER (PROXY)
10. **`corridor_cross_border_share_{window}`** — share of value flowing through cross-border `corridor`s + mix
    (`measure=cross_border_share/corridor_hhi`). **needs:** `corridor` · `country_code` (opt) ·
    `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. **eligibility:** corridor /
    country_code are national-origin PROXIES — payments/AML-permitted, bias-watched, NEVER a credit input.

**Concept substitutions (vs the §B6/§B7/§B14 designs).** None invented — every `Need` binds a real §3
concept. Noted on each template: (a) collections has no *contact-event / right-party-contact* concept →
`right_party_contact_intensity` anchors on `cost_to_collect` (the operational collections signal) with the
contact event a declared downstream derivation; (b) no *promise_to_pay* concept → `scheduled_amount` is the
promised due; (c) no *notice_period* concept → a notice-period deposit substitutes its notice term for
`tenor`; (d) no *chargeback* concept → the dispute/chargeback event is a declared derivation scoped by the
card `scheme`.

**Build note (B6/B7/B14).** These 30 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F/G/H — `needs`→
grounding contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/state guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise: `cure_reage_
dynamics`, `roll_forward_severity`, `days_in_collection`, `hardship_forbearance_in_collection`, and (the hard
POST-default pair) `recovery_rate`, `write_off_severity`. Routing + safety are verified by
`test_templates_core3.py`: each family grounds its whole domain-shaped catalog, the engine NEVER binds a
leakage anchor or a protected column, near-label recipes carry `near_label=True`, and none of the three
families grounds anything on the churn catalog (`ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn still yields exactly the churn lens).


# PART J — Appendix: markets + custody + asset-management full parametric sets (implements §B8 + §B10 + §B12)

The §B8 **markets/trading risk families + counterparty-risk funnel** (9 recipes, `templates.py::
MARKETS_TEMPLATES`), the §B10 **custody settlement-fail funnel** (8 recipes, `templates.py::
CUSTODY_TEMPLATES`) and the §B12 **asset-management redemption funnel + mandate compliance** (8 recipes,
`templates.py::ASSET_MGMT_TEMPLATES`) authored to Part-F/G/H/I depth — the recipes the template engine
grounds; all three families join `ALL_TEMPLATES` (now the **ten-family** union), which gate1 grounds. This
begins the BREADTH pass (core areas — churn · credit · fraud · AML · collections · deposits · payments —
were completed at full parametric depth in §PART F–I). Each is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-
construction (PIT baked in), and carries a degrade path. Concept names match the taxonomy (§3).

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule — the locked churn=churn-lens invariant).** Grounding is the
router, so a family surfaces ONLY where its distinctive concepts exist. An *entity* concept (`instrument_id`,
`book_id`, `netting_set_id`, `account_id`, `fund`, `share_class`) gets **structural `is_grain` credit** in the
matcher — it would bind ANY grain column, cross-surfacing onto a plain churn catalog. So every recipe REQUIRES
at least one domain-distinctive **NON-STRUCTURAL** concept that binds only by exact concept match:
- **markets:** `var` / `expected_shortfall` / `pv01` / `dv01` / `implied_volatility` / `notional` /
  `expected_exposure` / `potential_future_exposure` / `margin` / `limit` / `benchmark_rate` / `price` /
  `watchlist_hit_flag`;
- **custody:** `settlement_status` / `settlement_cycle` / `corporate_action` / `securities_loan` / `nav` /
  `custody_holding` (NOT the `settlement_fail` label — a leakage anchor);
- **asset-mgmt:** `fund_flow` / `benchmark` / `tracking_error` / `expense_ratio` / `mandate` / `nav` (NOT the
  `redeemed` label — a leakage anchor).

This holds the locked invariant, asserted by `test_templates_markets.py`: **`ALL_TEMPLATES` grounded on the
churn `_CATALOG` yields EXACTLY the churn lens** (each new family grounds nothing there). No recipe ever
`Need`s a leakage anchor (`default_flag` / `settlement_fail` / `redeemed` / `outcome_label`); the engine
refuses them by construction.

**Near-label / leakage discipline (safety by construction — CRITICAL for these funnels).** The two specialist
funnels are built from PRE-outcome signals, never their outcome flag:
- **settlement-fail prediction** is built from `settlement_status` (pending/failed HISTORY), `settlement_cycle`
  (T+n length) and `corporate_action` complexity — NEVER `settlement_fail`. A trailing fail RATE and (harder)
  the POST-fail `fail_ageing_buckets` BORDER the fail outcome → `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly
  pre-outcome / on prior instructions). PIT-CRITICAL: a fail is not knowable until T+n — honour `system_time`.
- **redemption** is built from `fund_flow` / relative performance / `tracking_error` — NEVER `redeemed`. The
  mandate-compliance tail (`tracking_error_breach_proximity`, `mandate_breach_proximity`) BORDERS the
  mandate/IMA-breach label → `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly pre-breach).
- **counterparty-risk funnel** (markets) mirrors credit; a counterparty `watchlist_hit_flag`
  (`counterparty_deterioration_ewi`) borders the close-out/default tail → `near_label=True`.

The market-risk MEASURES, the pre-fail custody signals and the flow/performance AM signals are NOT near-label
(they do not border their funnel outcome). Fair-lending: no recipe binds a `protected_attribute`
(engine-enforced). Markets data is MNPI / Chinese-wall aware (high model-risk tier for VaR/XVA).

## Markets / trading — risk families + the COUNTERPARTY-RISK funnel (`MARKETS_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — a "trading-ready" catalog needs:** `instrument_id` (grain) + `book_id` /
`netting_set_id` / `counterparty_id` / `desk_id` entities · `as_of_date` · the risk anchors `var` /
`expected_shortfall` · `pv01` / `dv01` / `implied_volatility` · `notional` / `position_direction` ·
`expected_exposure` / `potential_future_exposure` · `margin` · `limit` · `benchmark_rate` / `price` ·
`watchlist_hit_flag` / `adverse_media_flag` · plus the `default_flag` target (leakage anchor — never a
feature input). Additivity: VaR/ES/greeks/PFE non_additive (a quantile/greek — never summed across
books/netting sets), notional semi_additive, counts additive.

### Market-risk measures — point-in-time risk families
1. **`position_var_risk_{window}`** — VaR / expected-shortfall level or trend for a book (`measure=level/
   trend`). **needs:** `var` · `expected_shortfall` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `book_id`. **add:** non_additive.
   **explain:** M. *anchor `var`.*
2. **`greek_sensitivity_exposure_{window}`** — PV01/DV01/vega greek exposure level or trend (`greek∈{pv01,
   dv01,vega}`). **needs:** `pv01` · `dv01` (opt) · `implied_volatility` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `book_id`.
   **add:** non_additive. **explain:** H. *anchor `pv01` — position-additive only within one risk factor.*
3. **`notional_netting_exposure_{window}`** — gross vs net notional by netting set (`measure=gross_notional/
   net_notional`). **needs:** `notional` · `position_direction` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `netting_set_id`.
   **add:** semi_additive (gross-additive across positions, netted within a set, latest over time). **explain:** H.
7. **`book_desk_concentration_{window}`** — HHI / top-share of notional exposure by book/desk (`measure=book_hhi/

   pfe_level`). **needs:** `expected_exposure` · `potential_future_exposure` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
   `netting_set_id`. **add:** non_additive (EE sub-additive, PFE a quantile — never summed across netting sets).
   **explain:** M.
5. **`margin_call_intensity_{window}`** — rate/count of VM/IM margin calls, or the posted-margin level
   (`measure=call_intensity/call_count/im_level`). **needs:** `margin` · `event_timestamp` (opt) · `as_of_date`
   · `netting_set_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive; im=semi). **explain:** H.
9. **`counterparty_deterioration_ewi_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — a counterparty credit-watchlist (or
   adverse-media) hit + recency (`measure=watchlisted_flag/days_since_watchlist`). **needs:**
   `watchlist_hit_flag` · `adverse_media_flag` (opt, pii) · `as_of_date` · `counterparty_id`. **add:** n/a.
   **⚠ near-label:** watchlisting borders the close-out/default tail — observe strictly pre-close-out.

## Custody & securities services — the SETTLEMENT-FAIL funnel (`CUSTODY_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — a "custody-ready" catalog needs:** `account_id` (grain) + `instrument_id` ·
`as_of_date` · `event_timestamp` · `settlement_status` / `settlement_cycle` (the PRE-fail lifecycle) ·
`corporate_action` · `record_date` / `pay_date` · `securities_loan` · `nav` · `custody_holding` · plus the
`settlement_fail` target (leakage anchor — never a feature input). Additivity: rates non_additive, holdings
semi_additive (stock), counts additive. **PIT-CRITICAL:** a fail is not knowable until T+n (`settlement_cycle`)
— honour `system_time`.

### PRE-SETTLEMENT — matching + inventory aging (pre-fail signals)
1. **`matching_break_rate_{window}`** — trailing share of instructions UNMATCHED/mismatched at matching
   (`measure=break_rate/break_count`). **needs:** `settlement_status` · `event_timestamp` · `account_id`.
   **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive). *concept sub: no matching_status concept — settlement_status
   carries the unmatched value.*
2. **`pre_settlement_aging_{window}`** — pending instructions aging vs their T+n `settlement_cycle`
   (`measure=mean_pending_age/overdue_share`). **needs:** `settlement_cycle` · `settlement_status` (opt) ·
   `event_timestamp` · `account_id`. **add:** n/a (duration; overdue_share=non-additive). *anchor `settlement_cycle`.*

### SETTLEMENT DATE → FAIL ⚠ — the fail rate + fail-ageing (NEAR-LABEL; pre-fail history, never `settlement_fail`)
3. **`settlement_fail_rate_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** (the headline safety recipe) — trailing share of an
   account's/counterparty's instructions that reached a FAILED `settlement_status` vs settled, from historical
   status (a pre-fail predictor for a NEW instruction). **needs:** `settlement_status` · `settlement_cycle`
   (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `account_id`. **add:** non_additive (rate; count=additive). **⚠ the
   `settlement_fail` label is NEVER an input — the engine refuses the leakage anchor.**
4. **`fail_ageing_buckets_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — how long already-FAILED instructions have aged
   (`measure=aged_fail_share/mean_fail_age_days`), a POST-fail fail→buy-in tail signal. **needs:**
   `settlement_status` · `settlement_cycle` (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `account_id`. **add:** non_additive
   (share; age=n/a). **⚠ POST-fail** (like a collections post-charge-off signal) — observe on PRIOR/other
   instructions for a fail-prediction model, never the target's own post-fail age.

### ASSET-SERVICING — corporate actions, securities lending, NAV, custody holdings
5. **`corporate_action_complexity_{window}`** — count of corporate-action events / a complexity /
   elective-deadline-proximity score (`measure=ca_volume/complexity_score`). **needs:** `corporate_action` ·

## Asset management (buy-side) — the REDEMPTION funnel + mandate compliance (`ASSET_MGMT_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — an "asset-mgmt-ready" catalog needs:** `fund` (grain) + `share_class` ·
`as_of_date` · `event_timestamp` · `fund_flow` (net subs − redemptions) · `benchmark` (a performance INDEX) ·
`tracking_error` · `expense_ratio` · `nav` · a `monetary_stock` (AUM / liquid assets) · `mandate` (the IMA) ·
`peer_group` · plus the `redeemed` target (leakage anchor — never a feature input). Additivity: flows additive,
ratios/dispersion non_additive, AUM semi_additive. Distinguish `mandate` (the INVESTMENT mandate) from a
PAYMENT mandate (`direct_debit`/`standing_order`), and `benchmark` (an INDEX) from `benchmark_rate` (a rate).

### Investor-flow / redemption funnel (mirrors churn — built from `fund_flow`, NEVER `redeemed`)
1. **`net_fund_flow_trend_{window}`** — cumulative net flow / its trend / a redemption-pressure ratio
   (`measure=cumulative_net_flow/net_flow_trend/redemption_pressure`). **needs:** `fund_flow` ·
   `event_timestamp` · `fund`. **add:** additive (flow; trend=n/a; pressure=non-additive). *the safe
   pre-redemption signal, NOT the `redeemed` label.*
2. **`performance_vs_benchmark_{window}`** — relative return / return dispersion vs the `benchmark` index
   (`measure=relative_return/return_dispersion/underperformance_flag`). **needs:** `benchmark` ·
   `tracking_error` (opt) · `nav` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `fund`. **add:** non_additive. **explain:** H.
3. **`share_class_flow_mix_{window}`** — flow split/concentration across share classes / distribution
   (`measure=institutional_flow_share/flow_hhi`). **needs:** `fund_flow` · `share_class` · `event_timestamp`.
   **add:** non_additive (mix; underlying flows additive). *anchor `fund_flow` (share_class is an entity — not
   the sole anchor).*
4. **`redemption_liquidity_coverage_{window}`** — liquid assets vs trailing/expected redemptions, or
   redemption velocity (`measure=coverage_ratio/redemption_velocity`). **needs:** `fund_flow` ·
   `monetary_stock` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `event_timestamp` (opt) · `fund`. **add:** non_additive.
5. **`aum_stability_{window}`** — fund AUM level / trend / volatility (`measure=aum_level/aum_trend/
   aum_volatility`). **needs:** `nav` · `monetary_stock` (opt AUM) · `as_of_date` · `fund`. **add:**
   semi_additive (AUM stock; trend=n/a; volatility=non-additive).

### Mandate / portfolio compliance (⚠ near-label breach paths)
6. **`tracking_error_breach_proximity_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — active-risk (`tracking_error`) level +
   proximity to the mandate's TE limit (`measure=te_level/breach_proximity/breach_flag`). **needs:**
   `tracking_error` · `as_of_date` · `fund`. **add:** non_additive (flag=n/a). **⚠ near-label:** a TE-limit
   breach borders the mandate/IMA-breach label — observe strictly pre-breach.
7. **`mandate_breach_proximity_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — headroom to an IMA limit
   (sector/issuer/rating/concentration) + trend (`measure=headroom/breach_proximity/breached_flag`). **needs:**
   `mandate` · `as_of_date` · `fund`. **add:** non_additive (flag=n/a). **⚠ near-label:** a shrinking headroom
   borders the mandate-breach label — observe strictly pre-breach.
8. **`expense_ratio_competitiveness_{window}`** — TER/OCF level / trend / peer gap (`measure=ter_level/ter_trend/
   ter_vs_peer`). **needs:** `expense_ratio` · `peer_group` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `fund`. **add:** non_additive.

**Concept substitutions (vs the §B8/§B10/§B12 designs).** None invented — every `Need` binds a real §3
concept. Noted on each template: (a) custody has no *matching_status* concept → `matching_break_rate` reads the
unmatched value of `settlement_status`; (b) markets `benchmark_basis_dislocation` uses `benchmark_rate` (the
reference INTEREST rate), distinct from the AM `benchmark` INDEX; (c) the settlement-fail funnel is built from
`settlement_status`/`settlement_cycle` PRE-fail signals — the `settlement_fail` label is never a `Need`; (d) the
redemption funnel is built from `fund_flow`/performance PRE-signals — the `redeemed` label is never a `Need`.

**Build note (B8/B10/B12).** These 25 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F–I — `needs`→
grounding contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/state guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise:
`counterparty_deterioration_ewi` (markets), `settlement_fail_rate` + `fail_ageing_buckets` (custody), and
`tracking_error_breach_proximity` + `mandate_breach_proximity` (asset-mgmt). Routing + safety are verified by
`test_templates_markets.py`: each family grounds its whole domain-shaped catalog, the engine NEVER binds a
leakage anchor (headline: settlement-fail prediction never reads `settlement_fail`; redemption never reads
`redeemed`) or a protected column, near-label recipes carry `near_label=True`, and none of the three families
grounds anything on the churn catalog (`ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn still yields exactly the churn lens).

# PART K — Appendix: insurance + islamic + esg full parametric sets (implements §B9 + §B13 + §B11)

The §B9 **insurance/bancassurance lapse funnel + claims-fraud journey** (10 recipes, `templates.py::
INSURANCE_TEMPLATES`), the §B13 **Islamic-banking conventional funnels + Sharia-compliance overlay** (8
recipes, `templates.py::ISLAMIC_TEMPLATES`) and the §B11 **ESG / sustainable-finance scoring + transition-
risk journey** (9 recipes, `templates.py::ESG_TEMPLATES`) authored to Part-F/G/H/I/J depth — the recipes the
template engine grounds; all three families join `ALL_TEMPLATES` (now the **thirteen-family** union), which
gate1 grounds. This continues the BREADTH pass alongside §PART J (markets · custody · asset-management). Each
is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-construction (PIT baked in), and carries a degrade path. Concept
names match the taxonomy (§3).

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule — the locked churn=churn-lens invariant).** Grounding is the
router, so a family surfaces ONLY where its distinctive concepts exist. An *entity* concept (`policy_id`,
`claim_id`, `customer_id`, `counterparty_id`) gets **structural `is_grain` credit** in the matcher — it would
bind ANY grain column, cross-surfacing onto a plain churn catalog. So every recipe REQUIRES at least one
domain-distinctive **NON-STRUCTURAL** concept that binds only by exact concept match:
- **insurance:** `premium` / `surrender_value` / `claim_reserve` / `sum_assured` / `reinsurance_recoverable` /
  `mortality_morbidity` (NOT the `lapsed` / `surrendered` labels — leakage anchors);
- **islamic:** `profit_rate` / `profit_share_ratio` / `purification_amount` / `prohibited_activity_exposure` /
  `sukuk` / `takaful_contribution` (`profit_rate` is deliberately NOT `is_a monetary_rate` — a Sharia +
  modelling distinction, so it binds only by exact concept match);
- **esg:** `scope_1/2/3_emissions` / `financed_emissions` / `carbon_intensity` / `taxonomy_alignment` /
  `transition_alignment` / `physical_hazard_score` / `emissions_data_quality` / `sll_kpi`.

This holds the locked invariant, asserted by `test_templates_specialist.py`: **`ALL_TEMPLATES` grounded on the
churn `_CATALOG` yields EXACTLY the churn lens** (each new family grounds nothing there). No recipe ever
`Need`s a leakage anchor (`lapsed` / `surrendered` / `fraud_flag` / `outcome_label`); the engine refuses them
by construction.

**Near-label / leakage discipline (safety by construction — CRITICAL for these funnels).**
- **lapse / surrender prediction** is built from PRE-lapse signals (`premium` payment irregularity,
  missed-premium streak, `surrender_value` trend, policy-loan utilisation) — NEVER `lapsed` / `surrendered`.
  The **claims-fraud typology** (`claims_fraud_typology`) is built from claim BEHAVIOUR (early-claim /
  over-servicing) and BORDERS the SIU/confirmed-fraud label → `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly
  pre-label; `fraud_flag` is never an input).
- **Islamic** reframes conventional funnels on **profit-rate, not interest**; the Sharia-compliance overlay's
  `prohibited_activity_exposure_share` crossing a 5%/33% screen BORDERS the compliance-breach determination →
  `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly pre-breach). Sharia compliance is a HARD eligibility gate.
- **ESG** carries no near-label recipe (an ESG/climate signal does not border a customer outcome), but the
  **additivity double-count GUARD** is load-bearing: GHG scopes are additive WITHIN a scope, a naive scope
  1+2+3 total DOUBLE-COUNTS the value chain, Scope 3 is not summable across a PORTFOLIO (cross-entity
  double-count), `financed_emissions` is PCAF-ATTRIBUTED (additive across the book), `carbon_intensity` is a
  ratio (non_additive). Each recipe picks additivity honestly and annotates the trap in `notes`.

Sensitivity: `mortality_morbidity` is the actuarial RATE (bindable, public) — an individual's health STATUS
is `special_category` (the engine BLOCKS binding it). Fair-lending: no recipe binds a `protected_attribute`
(engine-enforced); `geographic` in `physical_hazard_exposure` is CLIMATE-legitimate, NOT a credit proxy.

## Insurance / bancassurance — the LAPSE funnel + CLAIMS-FRAUD journey (`INSURANCE_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — an "insurance-ready" catalog needs:** `policy_id` (grain) + `customer_id` ·

(policy loan) · `scheduled_amount` (premium due) · `product_type` · a `monetary_flow` (income) · plus the
`lapsed` / `surrendered` targets (leakage anchors — never a feature input). Additivity: premiums/claim-counts

4. **`policy_loan_utilisation_{window}`** — policy loan drawn ÷ surrender value (`measure=utilisation/
   loan_trend`). **needs:** `surrender_value` · `monetary_stock` (loan) · `as_of_date` · `policy_id`. **add:**

### CLAIMS journey — frequency/severity + the claims-fraud typology (behaviour, near-label ⚠)
5. **`claims_frequency_severity_{window}`** — claim frequency / severity (incurred `claim_reserve`) / loss
   ratio (`measure=frequency/severity/loss_ratio`). **needs:** `claim_reserve` · `premium` (opt) ·

9. **`bancassurance_cross_hold_{window}`** — count of premium-paying policies alongside banking products /
   cross-hold flag / premium share (`measure=policy_count/cross_hold_flag/premium_share`). **needs:**
   `premium` · `product_type` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** additive (count). *concept sub:

    loading (`measure=rate_level/loading_factor`). **needs:** `mortality_morbidity` · `as_of_date` ·
    `policy_id`. **add:** non_additive. **⚠ HEALTH-ADJACENT:** the RATE is bindable; a health-STATUS
    `special_category` column is engine-blocked; consent/purpose eligibility on the underlying medical data.

## Islamic banking — conventional funnels reframed + the SHARIA-COMPLIANCE overlay (`ISLAMIC_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — an "islamic-ready" catalog needs:** `customer_id` (grain) · `as_of_date` ·
`event_timestamp` · `profit_rate` · `benchmark_rate` · `profit_share_ratio` · `purification_amount` ·
`prohibited_activity_exposure` · `sukuk` · `takaful_contribution` · a `monetary_stock` (balance/holding) · a

### SHARIA-COMPLIANCE overlay
1. **`profit_rate_exposure_{window}`** — profit-rate level / spread vs a benchmark / trend
   (`measure=rate_level/benchmark_spread/trend`). **needs:** `profit_rate` · `benchmark_rate` (opt) ·

2. **`profit_sharing_split_behaviour_{window}`** — Mudaraba/Musharaka PSR level + realised-profit volatility
   (`measure=psr_level/psr_volatility`). **needs:** `profit_share_ratio` · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`.

   (`measure=concentration_hhi/holding_share/holding_amount`). **needs:** `sukuk` · `monetary_stock` (opt) ·

## ESG / sustainable finance — SCORING + the TRANSITION-RISK journey (`ESG_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — an "esg-ready" catalog needs:** `counterparty_id` (grain) · `as_of_date` ·
`scope_1/2/3_emissions` · `financed_emissions` · `carbon_intensity` · `emissions_data_quality` ·
`taxonomy_alignment` · `transition_alignment` · `physical_hazard_score` · `sll_kpi` · `geographic` (climate-
legit) · a `monetary_stock` (exposure) · plus the `outcome_label` target (leakage anchor). **Additivity GUARD:**
per-scope emissions additive WITHIN a scope (never a naive scope 1+2+3 total — value-chain double-count; Scope
3 not summable across a PORTFOLIO — cross-entity double-count); `financed_emissions` PCAF-ATTRIBUTED (additive
across the book); `carbon_intensity` a ratio (non_additive).

### SCORING / EMISSIONS — absolute & intensity by scope (the additivity double-count guard)
1. **`emissions_trend_by_scope_{window}`** — per-scope absolute level / trend or a carbon-intensity trend
   (`measure=absolute_level/absolute_trend/intensity_trend`). **needs:** `scope_1_emissions` ·
   `scope_2_emissions` (opt) · `scope_3_emissions` (opt) · `carbon_intensity` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
   `counterparty_id`. **add:** additive WITHIN a scope (intensity non-additive). **⚠ never a naive cross-scope
   sum.** **explain:** H.
2. **`carbon_intensity_trajectory_{window}`** — emissions ÷ revenue level / trend (`measure=level/trend`).
   **needs:** `carbon_intensity` · `as_of_date` · `counterparty_id`. **add:** non_additive (a ratio).
3. **`financed_emissions_attribution_{window}`** — PCAF financed emissions absolute / intensity / trend
   (`measure=absolute/intensity/trend`). **needs:** `financed_emissions` · `monetary_stock` (exposure, opt) ·
   `as_of_date` · `counterparty_id`. **add:** additive (attributed — avoids the cross-entity double-count).
4. **`emissions_data_quality_reliance_{window}`** — PCAF data-quality score / estimated-share provenance
   (`measure=avg_data_quality/estimated_share`). **needs:** `emissions_data_quality` · `as_of_date` ·
   `counterparty_id`. **add:** non_additive (ordinal). *high estimated-share = low confidence.*
9. **`scope3_value_chain_exposure_{window}`** — Scope-3 (15-category) absolute / trend, the ESTIMATED tail
   (`measure=absolute/trend`). **needs:** `scope_3_emissions` · `emissions_data_quality` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
   `counterparty_id`. **add:** additive WITHIN one firm; **NOT summable across a PORTFOLIO** (cross-entity
   double-count — use `financed_emissions`) and never summed with Scope 1/2. **explain:** M.

### TRANSITION-RISK journey (ALIGNED → LAGGING → HIGH-RISK → STRANDED)
5. **`taxonomy_alignment_share_{window}`** — EU-Taxonomy aligned / eligible share / trend
   (`measure=aligned_share/eligible_share/trend`). **needs:** `taxonomy_alignment` · `as_of_date` ·
   `counterparty_id`. **add:** non_additive (a ratio).
6. **`transition_alignment_gap_{window}`** — net-zero pathway gap / implied temp rise level / trend
   (`measure=alignment_level/pathway_gap/trend`). **needs:** `transition_alignment` · `as_of_date` ·
   `counterparty_id`. **add:** non_additive.
7. **`physical_hazard_exposure_{window}`** — flood/heat/wildfire hazard score / high-hazard share
   (`measure=hazard_score/high_hazard_share`). **needs:** `physical_hazard_score` · `geographic` (opt) ·
   `as_of_date` · `counterparty_id`. **add:** non_additive. *`geographic` is CLIMATE-legit, NOT a credit proxy.*
8. **`sll_kpi_achievement_{window}`** — SLL/bond KPI vs the SPT (margin-ratchet) achievement / breach flag /
   trend (`measure=achievement/breach_flag/trend`). **needs:** `sll_kpi` · `as_of_date` · `counterparty_id`.
   **add:** non_additive (breach_flag n/a).

**Concept substitutions (vs the §B9/§B13/§B11 designs).** None invented — every `Need` binds a real §3
concept. Noted on each template: (a) insurance has no policy-loan / premium-due / income concept →
`policy_loan_utilisation` sizes a `monetary_stock` against `surrender_value`, `missed_premium_streak` reads the
premium DUE off `scheduled_amount`, `sum_assured_adequacy` uses a `monetary_flow` income proxy; (b)
bancassurance has no product_holding concept → `product_type`; (c) Islamic `profit_rate` (deliberately not
`is_a monetary_rate`) replaces interest in every rate feature and `murabaha_installment_behaviour` reads the
installment DUE off `scheduled_amount`; (d) the lapse funnel is built from `premium`/`surrender_value` PRE-
signals — the `lapsed`/`surrendered` labels are never a `Need`.

**Build note (B9/B13/B11).** These 27 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F–J — `needs`→
grounding contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/state guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise:
`claims_fraud_typology` (insurance) and `prohibited_activity_exposure_share` (islamic); ESG carries none but
the additivity double-count GUARD is exercised on `emissions_trend_by_scope` + `scope3_value_chain_exposure`.
Routing + safety are verified by `test_templates_specialist.py`: each family grounds its whole domain-shaped
catalog, the engine NEVER binds a leakage anchor (headline: lapse prediction never reads `lapsed`/
`surrendered`) or a protected column, near-label recipes carry `near_label=True`, and none of the three
families grounds anything on the churn catalog (`ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn still yields exactly the churn lens).

# PART L — Appendix: cross-sell/clv + corporate-trade full parametric sets (implements §B5 + §B15)

The §B5 **cross-sell / CLV GROWTH journey** (10 recipes, `templates.py::CROSS_SELL_TEMPLATES`) and the §B15
**corporate / SME trade & supply-chain-finance** set (11 recipes, `templates.py::CORPORATE_TRADE_TEMPLATES`)
authored to Part-F/G/H/I/J/K depth — the recipes the template engine grounds. These two families are the
FINAL breadth pass: both join `ALL_TEMPLATES` (now the **fifteen-family** union — the complete library),
which gate1 grounds. Each is groundable by concept-matching, safe-by-construction (PIT baked in), and carries
a degrade path. Concept names match the taxonomy (§3) — no concept was invented.

**Routing discipline (the load-bearing rule — the locked churn=churn-lens invariant; ⚠ CLV is the HARDEST
case).** Grounding is the router, so a family surfaces ONLY where its distinctive concepts exist. An *entity*
concept (`product_id`, `campaign_id`, `household_id`, `relationship_manager_id`, `invoice_id`, `obligor_id`,
`guarantor_id`, `pooling_structure_id`) gets **structural `is_grain` credit** in the matcher — it would bind
ANY grain column, cross-surfacing onto a plain churn catalog. Cross-sell/CLV is the **INVERSE of churn and
SHARES its generic concepts** (`monetary_flow` / `event_timestamp` / `customer_id`) — a CLV recipe needing
ONLY those would cross-surface and BREAK the invariant. So every recipe REQUIRES at least one domain-
distinctive **NON-STRUCTURAL** concept that binds only by exact concept match:
- **cross-sell / CLV:** `product_type` / `segment` / `peer_group` / `channel` (all four exist — no
  substitution needed; the entity concepts ride as the grain / an optional link, never the sole anchor);
- **corporate / trade & SCF:** `limit` / `limit_type` / `contingent_exposure` / `covenant` /
  `syndication_share` / `collateral_type` / `ownership_percentage` (the entity concepts `invoice_id` /
  `obligor_id` / `guarantor_id` / `pooling_structure_id` ride as the grain / aggregation link).

This holds the locked invariant, asserted by `test_templates_growth_trade.py`: **`ALL_TEMPLATES` grounded on
the churn `_CATALOG` yields EXACTLY the churn lens** (each new family grounds nothing there — the CLV test
specifically proves the inverse-of-churn family does not cross-surface despite sharing churn's generics). No
recipe ever `Need`s a leakage anchor (`outcome_label` = the purchased/converted label for cross-sell;
`default_flag` / `outcome_label` for corporate); the engine refuses them by construction.

**Near-label / leakage discipline (safety by construction).**
- **cross-sell propensity** is built from PRE-purchase BEHAVIOUR (product gaps, engagement, campaign
  exposure) — NEVER the conversion / purchased `outcome_label` (the HEADLINE: a next-best-product propensity
  must not read the conversion label). The growth journey carries **no near-label** — "conversion" is a HARD
  leakage anchor, not a bordering near-label. **CLV** is a DECLARED PROJECTION (no data plane computes the
  forward lifetime value). Fair-lending: no protected-attribute inference for targeting (engine-blocked).
- **corporate** carries ONE near-label: `covenant_headroom_breach` — a covenant breach BORDERS the group
  default / restructure label → `near_label=True` + a ⚠ note (observe strictly pre-breach). **DSO /
  trade-cycle length / working-capital gap** are DECLARED PROJECTIONS over the invoice + flow history.
  Additivity is honest per measure: exposures/contingents semi_additive (STOCKS), utilisation/concentration/
  DSO non_additive (ratios), counts additive; group exposures aggregate UP the ownership hierarchy
  (`ownership_percentage` is the consolidation weight, §A6 `group_exposure_sum`).

## Cross-sell / CLV — the GROWTH journey (`CROSS_SELL_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — a "cross-sell-ready" catalog needs:** `customer_id` (grain) · `as_of_date` ·
`event_timestamp` · `effective_date` (holdings open/close, origination) · a `monetary_flow` (revenue/spend) ·
`product_type` · `segment` · `peer_group` · `channel` · plus the entity links `product_id` · `campaign_id` ·
`household_id` · `relationship_manager_id`, plus the `outcome_label` target (the purchased/converted label —
a leakage anchor, never a feature input). Additivity: counts/revenue additive, ratios/share-of-wallet
non_additive, propensity n/a.

### ONBOARDING / ACTIVATION
1. **`channel_adoption_depth_{window}`** — distinct servicing channels + digital-led share / adoption trend
   (`measure=digital_share/distinct_channels/adoption_trend`). **needs:** `channel` · `event_timestamp` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `channel` (exists — no substitution).*

### DEEPENING (cross-sell windows)
2. **`product_gap_whitespace_{window}`** — count of products the SEGMENT holds that this customer lacks
   (`measure=gap_count/whitespace_flag`). **needs:** `product_type` · `segment` · `effective_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** additive (count). *anchor `product_type`+`segment`.*
3. **`next_best_product_propensity_{window}`** — pre-purchase blend of gaps + engagement + spend that ranks
   the next product (`measure=propensity_signal/gap_engagement_score`). **needs:** `product_type` ·

   *built from BEHAVIOUR, NEVER the conversion label.*
4. **`relationship_deepening_breadth_{window}`** — product-breadth GROWTH (`measure=breadth/breadth_growth`),
   the positive INVERSE of churn's product_attrition. **needs:** `product_type` · `effective_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** additive. *DISTINCT id from churn's `product_breadth`.*
5. **`campaign_response_recency_{window}`** — response rate / recency / count over product-cross-sell
   campaigns (`measure=response_rate/days_since_last_response/response_count`). **needs:** `product_type` ·
   `campaign_id` · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `product_type`
   (`campaign_id` is an ENTITY concept — not the sole anchor); built from response BEHAVIOUR.*

### MATURITY
6. **`clv_revenue_trajectory_{window}`** — revenue by product / trend / forward CLV projection
   (`measure=revenue/revenue_trend/clv_projection`). **needs:** `monetary_flow` · `product_type` ·
   `product_id` (opt) · `event_timestamp` · `customer_id`. **add:** additive (revenue). *anchor
   `product_type` (monetary_flow + event_ts + customer_id are SHARED with churn — product_type is load-
   bearing for routing); CLV is a DECLARED projection (no data plane).*
7. **`share_of_wallet_growth_{window}`** — held products/revenue as a share of the eligible catalog + its
   growth (`measure=sow_level/sow_growth`). **needs:** `product_type` · `monetary_flow` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive (a share).
8. **`segment_relative_penetration_{window}`** — under-penetration vs the PEER GROUP (`measure=penetration_
   gap/relative_holding_index`). **needs:** `peer_group` · `product_type` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
   `customer_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `peer_group`.*

### AGGREGATION
9. **`household_relationship_value_{window}`** — product breadth / revenue / share summed across a HOUSEHOLD
   (or an RM book) (`measure=household_breadth/household_revenue/household_revenue_share`). **needs:**
   `product_type` · `household_id` (grain) · `relationship_manager_id` (opt) · `as_of_date`. **add:** additive
   (rollup). *anchor `product_type` (`household_id`/`relationship_manager_id` are the aggregation grain).*

### DEEPENING (readiness)
10. **`tenure_upsell_readiness_{window}`** — relationship tenure × held product mix → upsell-readiness score
    (`measure=upsell_ready_flag/tenure_gap_score`). **needs:** `product_type` · `effective_date` (origination)
    · `as_of_date` · `customer_id`. **add:** n/a. *anchor `product_type` (tenure alone is generic — would
    cross-surface).*

## Corporate / SME — trade & supply-chain finance (`CORPORATE_TRADE_TEMPLATES`)

**Grounding requirements — a "corporate-ready" catalog needs:** `facility_id` (grain) + `obligor_id` ·
`as_of_date` · `event_timestamp` · `limit` · `limit_type` · `contingent_exposure` · a drawn `monetary_stock`
· an invoice `monetary_flow` · `covenant` · `syndication_share` · `collateral_type` · `ownership_percentage` ·
the entity links `invoice_id` · `guarantor_id` · `pooling_structure_id`, plus the `default_flag` /
`outcome_label` target (leakage anchor — never a feature input). Additivity: exposures/contingents
semi_additive (STOCKS), utilisation/concentration/DSO non_additive, counts additive.

### WORKING CAPITAL / FACILITY
11. **`facility_utilisation_headroom_{window}`** — drawn ÷ limit / headroom / undrawn share
    (`measure=utilisation/headroom/undrawn_share`). **needs:** `limit` · `contingent_exposure` (opt) ·
    `monetary_stock` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `limit` (nested
    sub-limits — never naively sum).*

### TRADE FINANCE (LC / guarantee)
12. **`lc_guarantee_rollover_{window}`** — contingent (LC/guarantee) level / utilisation / rollover rate
    (`measure=contingent_level/utilisation/rollover_rate`). **needs:** `contingent_exposure` ·
    `event_timestamp` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **add:** semi_additive (the contingent stock).
    *anchor `contingent_exposure` (an LC/guarantee/committed line; converts on drawdown via the ccf).*

### INVOICE / RECEIVABLES FINANCE
13. **`invoice_finance_dynamics_{window}`** — DSO / dilution / debtor concentration over the financed
    receivables pool (`measure=dso/dilution_rate/debtor_concentration_hhi`). **needs:** `collateral_type` ·
    `invoice_id` · `monetary_flow` · `event_timestamp` · `obligor_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor
    `collateral_type` (receivables ARE a collateral_type; `invoice_id` is the receivables grain); DSO /
    dilution are DECLARED projections.*

### SUPPLY-CHAIN FINANCE
14. **`supply_chain_finance_dynamics_{window}`** — anchor-buyer dependence / payment-term extension / program
    utilisation over the committed SCF program (`measure=anchor_buyer_dependence/payment_term_extension/
    program_utilisation`). **needs:** `contingent_exposure` · `monetary_flow` (opt) · `event_timestamp` (opt)
    · `as_of_date` · `obligor_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `contingent_exposure` (the committed
    program line).*

### COVENANT PRESSURE (near-label)
15. **`covenant_headroom_breach_{window}`** ⚠ **near-label** — leverage/DSCR/ICR headroom / breach proximity /
    breached flag / trend (`measure=headroom/breach_proximity/breached_flag/trend`). **needs:** `covenant` ·
    `as_of_date` · `obligor_id`. **add:** non_additive. **⚠ near-label:** a covenant breach borders the group
    default/restructure label — observe strictly pre-breach.

### SYNDICATION / GROUP / CREDIT MITIGATION
16. **`syndication_concentration_{window}`** — lender's syndication share / book concentration HHI / top-deal
    share (`measure=share_level/concentration_hhi/top_deal_share`). **needs:** `syndication_share` ·
    `as_of_date` · `facility_id`. **add:** non_additive. **explain:** M. *anchor `syndication_share`.*
17. **`group_exposure_aggregation_{window}`** — combined exposure summed UP the ownership hierarchy /
    single-obligor share / group concentration HHI (`measure=group_exposure/single_obligor_share/group_
    concentration_hhi`). **needs:** `ownership_percentage` · `monetary_stock` (opt) · `as_of_date` ·
    `obligor_id`. **add:** semi_additive (the group exposure stock). *anchor `ownership_percentage` (the group
    consolidation weight, §A6).*
18. **`guarantor_reliance_{window}`** — guaranteed share / guarantor concentration / heavy-reliance flag
    (`measure=guaranteed_share/guarantor_concentration/reliance_flag`). **needs:** `collateral_type` ·
    `guarantor_id` · `contingent_exposure` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `obligor_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor
    `collateral_type` (a guarantee IS a collateral_type; `guarantor_id` is the guarantor grain).*

### WORKING CAPITAL / CASH MANAGEMENT
19. **`trade_cycle_working_capital_{window}`** — working-capital gap (DSO+DIO−DPO) / trade-cycle length /
    trend, scoped to the trade/WC facility by its limit_type (`measure=working_capital_gap/trade_cycle_length/
    wc_gap_trend`). **needs:** `limit_type` · `limit` (opt) · `monetary_flow` (opt) · `event_timestamp` (opt) ·
    `as_of_date` · `obligor_id`. **add:** non_additive. *anchor `limit_type`; WC gap / trade cycle are
    DECLARED projections.*
20. **`pooling_structure_utilisation_{window}`** — cash-pool utilisation vs the pool limit / notional-pooling
    benefit / intraday-peak share (`measure=pool_utilisation/notional_pool_benefit/intraday_peak_share`).
    **needs:** `limit` · `monetary_stock` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `pooling_structure_id`. **add:**
    non_additive. **explain:** M. *anchor `limit` (`pooling_structure_id` is the pool grain).*

### CORPORATE DETERIORATION FUNNEL (early-warning)
21. **`cross_product_stress_count_{window}`** — # product lines simultaneously stressed across a group /
    combined exposure trend / trade-flow decline (`measure=stressed_line_count/combined_exposure_trend/
    trade_flow_decline`). **needs:** `limit` · `contingent_exposure` (opt) · `as_of_date` · `obligor_id`.
    **add:** additive (count). *anchor `limit` — an early-warning (counts stress BEFORE any breach), NOT
    near-label.*

**Concept substitutions (vs the §B5/§B15 designs).** None invented — every `Need` binds a real §3 concept.
Noted on each template: (a) cross-sell — `channel` exists (no substitution); the whitespace / share-of-wallet
comparisons (segment basket, eligible catalog, estimated wallet) and the CLV projection are DECLARED
downstream derivations (§D.8); (b) corporate — no dedicated DSO / dilution / working-capital / trade-cycle
concept → `invoice_finance_dynamics` binds `collateral_type=receivables` + `invoice_id` and declares DSO /
dilution downstream, `trade_cycle_working_capital` scopes on `limit_type` and declares the WC gap / cycle
length; a guarantee binds `collateral_type=guarantee` (`guarantor_reliance`); the group consolidation is a
declared `Σ exposure × ownership_percentage` up the hierarchy.

**Build note (B5/B15).** These 21 map 1:1 to the `templates.py` model exactly like §PART F–K — `needs`→
grounding contract, `params`→parameter schema, `pit`→trailing-window/state guard, `degrade`→fallback,
`near_label`→the 3-part leakage flag. The near-label subset the golden set must exercise: `covenant_headroom_
breach` (corporate); cross-sell carries none but the HEADLINE leakage guard is exercised on every cross-sell
recipe (a propensity must not read the conversion `outcome_label`). Routing + safety are verified by
`test_templates_growth_trade.py`: each family grounds its whole domain-shaped catalog, the engine NEVER binds
a leakage anchor (headline: cross-sell propensity never reads the purchased/converted label) or a protected
column, the near-label covenant recipe carries `near_label=True`, and neither family grounds anything on the
churn catalog (`ALL_TEMPLATES` on churn still yields exactly the churn lens — the CLV test proves the
inverse-of-churn family does not cross-surface despite sharing churn's generic concepts).
